# SINAI-SA Corpus
## Description
This corpus has been prepared by the SINAI group in December 2008. SINAI SA (Sentiment Analysis) was created by tracking the Amazon website. Nearly 2,000 comments were extracted from different cameras.

*Structure:* The SINAI corpus contains 5 directories and each represents the number of stars for reviews. (eg directory 1 contains rated with a star). Each directory contains a file in plain text by document/comment.

The amount of comments is as follows:

- 1…star: 78 comments
- 2…stars: 67 comments
- 3…stars: 97 comments
- 4…stars: 411 comments
- 5…stars: 1,290 comments
Total: 1,943 comments

abstract = {Recently, opinion mining is receiving more attention due to the abundance of forums, blogs, e-commerce web sites, news reports and additional web sources where people tend to express their opinions. Opinion mining is the task of identifying whether the opinion expressed in a document is positive or negative about a given topic. In this paper we explore this new research area applying Support Vector Machines (SVM) for testing different domains of data sets and using several weighting schemes. We have accomplished experiments with different features on three corpora. Two of them have already been used in several works. The last one has been built from Amazon.com specifically for this paper in order to prove the feasibility of the SVM for different domains.}
