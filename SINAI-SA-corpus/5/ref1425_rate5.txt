        Kodac Z740, February 19, 2006
        ByChristopher Boyd "World Changer" (San Diego, Ca)  - See all my reviews
We purchased this camera prior to a family trip to Las Vegas. We took over 100 pictures which varied from bright daylight to indoor and outdoor casino pictures. The multiple (easy to use) settings allowed us to quickly change from one setting to another. The Kodak software (inclued) makes the tranfer of pictures automatic and painless, with several options on picture modification. I would recommend this 5.0 MP camera for anyone, regardless of camera skills. I would further recommend you either purchase the Kodac rechargable battery system or buy the Energizer system with a minimum 2000 mAh battery. Disposible batteries do not last long in this camera, the rechargable batteries lasted an average of 4X longer, which is much more reliable and prevents the loss of "that perfect Kodak moment" with the children.
