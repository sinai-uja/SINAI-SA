If I had to be stuck with one camera, this one would be it. I've owned it for a year and it's fantastic! What do you want for $150? This is a steal. It takes better pix than my friend's and family's cameras that are 2-3x more expensive.PROS:1. Battery life is unbelievable -- with lithium batteries it takes about 550 shots. Plus it will use rechargable ones as well.2. Pictures are excellent - vivid, colorful, crisp.3. Extremely easy to use.4. Fast at reloading.5. Great price.6. Video feature is great, sound is decent.CONS:1. Cannot zoom while video recording.
