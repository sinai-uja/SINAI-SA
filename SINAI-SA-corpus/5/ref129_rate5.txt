I really like this camera. It doesn't have as much megapixals as a K. brand I owned but I perfer this one. Love the way it's built easy to hold and feels very secure in my hand. Pics are clear and crisp. The zoom is good for the 4x to get better you'll probably have to go up to a bigger camera. This one is small but not tiny so my husband can hold and use just as easily. But it still can fit in my purse. I would recommend this to anyone and I haven't even tried all the modes yet. Cant wait to try the continuos shooting mode at my cousins next rodeo.
