        I am so glad I bought this, January 11, 2009

I have now had this camera for six months.  I am SO glad I bought it.  Excellent pictures.  Easy to shoot.  I have never owned a slim camera like this, and find it constantly in my purse or pocket and getting taken out to use.  I even used it as a copier when my friend's daughter needed a copy of a handout and we didn't have a scanner.  We took the picture, popped the chip into the computer, and printed out a good quality copy.CONS: It's sometimes hard to get the adjustments right for the color in low light (they adjustments are there, but I'm not an expert on it).  I wish the cover for the chip and battery was metal - it hasn't broken, but I'm sure it will be the first thing to go.  I bought this camera after a lot of research and a very good picture by picture comparison by Pogue of the NY Times.  I am SO happy with it.
