        Love the 10x zoom!, October 17, 2005

Couldn't be happier with this camera - I use the sports mode and the zoom at my daughters soccer games and I am continually told how great the pics are! Shutter speed is so much better than my old digital(Nikon Coolpix). It's very easy to use, downloading is a snap ... internal memory is WAY cool! I accidentally left the memory card (bought seperately) in my computer one day, but was thrilled when I remembered that I could use the internal memory to take pictures. I have used the camera a lot in the past month and still have not replaced the batteries. The lens cap does pop off a lot, but the strap keeps it from actually falling. I think it's a great camera for an average user like myself - not a novice or a pro. Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera.
