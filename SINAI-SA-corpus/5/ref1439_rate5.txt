I got this camera for the use in a digital photo class.  It was wonderful.  There wasn't anything that confused me when I first got it, and it took great pictures.  The software was a little tricky because it moved all of my photos to a different place that gave me very little access, but that was easily taken care of by uninstalling the software and using the USB cable by itself.The 10x zoom is great, but if you move at all your picture can be quite blurry.  I would get a tripod to use when you have it zoomed really far in.Overall it's a great camera that takes great pictures and good video.
