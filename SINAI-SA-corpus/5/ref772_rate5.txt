        Excellent Pocket Camera & Camcorder, January 16, 2009

I was really surprised to see a few bad ratings for this camera. I'm pretty picky about my equipment, and do a lot of research before buying. I'm very happy with my SD1100IS. It has a quick button-to-shutter speed timing, excellent auto focus, super clear pictures and superb color quality. It also makes for a perfect camcorder, and the Image Stability is a life saver.I have traveled to beaches and cities in the US, the Middle East and Europe with it, and for about a year now have never had a problem. For two hundred dollars I got this camera and a 4 gigabyte memory card shipped.I suspect that people who have problems with their cameras either faced one of two situations. 1.The camera was defective out of the box, in which case anyone should immediately return it for a full refund. 2.They dropped it hard and either didn't notice or won't admit it. At any rate, when you buy something with a trusty credit card, you should consider yourself protected for at least 90 days for a full refund.As far as pocket cameras go, I find Canon to be the best choice. I use a Nikon in my studio for product photography, and have tested many brands including plenty of Sony models, always returning to the Canons for price friendly and reliable point & shoots.
