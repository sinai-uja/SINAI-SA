        Great Camera for Outdoors, December 26, 2008
        ByC. A. Cortes Gomez (Mexico City)  - See all my reviews
Previously, I owned a Samsung digital camera which performed quite well in outdoors but not very resistant to be used outdoors. This Olympus camera is simply awesome. You can take it wherever you want and it will resist almost everything. I love to do four-wheeling in mud, snow, deserts, forests all the four seasons and of course go to the beach and sea and I have no complains about this camera. Clearly it is not a DSRL camera but you will get very decent high quality pictures.
