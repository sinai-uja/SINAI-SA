There is no exceptional about the Nikon or Cannon of the same genre, moreover the pentax offers nice features for the bucks paid. The same competitor models are pricey comapred to k200d. The shutter speed is good, sensitivity priority mode is good, full auto feature rocks. The image stabiliazation on body is very nice, it does work nice. May be the stabilization on lens would be more accurate. However, for the kind of price paid on lens with image stabilzation on nikon or cannon, I 100% prefer to have the pentax. It's a really a nice product, and i hope nobdoy ever dissapointed.
