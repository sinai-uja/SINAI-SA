I have owned several canon camera's from the a310 to the a95 and this one the a630 simply blows them all away. pic quality is excellent, especially when I compare the difference in two same shots between the a95 and the a630. the a630 is sharper,more vivid, and the features and ease of use is outstanding.AA batteries is a plus, I do recommend rechargeable batteries.8 mp is the way to go. also get at least a 1 gig sd card.
