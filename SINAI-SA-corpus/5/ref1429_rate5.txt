        User Friendly Digital Camera and Dock, August 21, 2006

My husband and I are in our 60s and have never used a digital camera before.  Most of the time we can't figure out which buttons to push to change our Cable to DVD.  This camera and the docking station are so user friendly that my husband took pictures and printed them, sent them and saved them without having to review the book or ask me what I thought.  Easy to operate with the few buttons performing more than one function is great.  The pictures come out beautifully and we are so happy to be able to pick and chose what we want (no more extra pictures that you don't know what to do with or what they were of).  Very happy with the service from Amazon.
