        Very pleased, June 16, 2008
        ByMikhail Stoma "3dMike" (Mexico)  - See all my reviews
For over five years I used 3.2MP Olympus D-540 camera. It still works fine. But I decided to step up for some more megapixels.I purchased Panasonic Lumix LZ7... It was ok, but I didn't get "wow effect" as I expected...Then I purchased Olympus FE-340, same absence of "wow".Then I got Fujifilm Finepix S700... I still felt that my old Olympus was getting better shots.Then I decided to get a real camera... After a lot of research I decided to go with Pentax K200D. After I saw the first shot with it, I got that "wow effect" I expected. Really sharp photo and real colors.And this camera still makes me wow each time I make a shot. Like another reviewer said: "you really can not make a bad shot". It's my first DSRL camera, so I can not compare it to any else. But some things that convinced me to get it were: -Weather resistant build. It even has seals in memory slot, USB port and battery port.-Hardware shake reduction function. Still didn't get any blurred image, and I believe my hands are not "shake-free".-Accessible AA batteries (you can get it in every shop)-Really fast Autofocus (according to one review 1.2 seconds compared to Rebels 3 seconds)The only bad thing I found (or may better to say: I didn't expect) is that you are obliged to see thru viewfinder to make a shot... Something I didn't expect from a digital camera. But I'm used to it, because I still remember how to use my father's old Zenith 35mm camera.Other than that it's a great camera that takes sharp photos with life-bright colors.
