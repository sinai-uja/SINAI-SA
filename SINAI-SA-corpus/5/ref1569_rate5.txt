        The best camera ever, December 12, 2008
        ByNicholl L. Mathews "Ladybuggs" (Anchorage, AK USA)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this camera because my old camera was stolen.  I previously owned the Olympus 720 SW.  The 1030SW is absolutely awesome.  It is SOOOOO much more user friendly than the other one I had and it takes much better pictures and video.  Adjusting the settings to best fit lighting and movement is idiot proof.  PLUS....it's freeze proof, water proof, dust proof and impact resistant!  Which makes it PERFECT for snowboarding, snorkling, four wheeling, paragliding, surfing, swimming...you name it!  It is the BEST camera available for adventurous people who love an adrenaline rush....it is the only camera that can keep up with me :-)
