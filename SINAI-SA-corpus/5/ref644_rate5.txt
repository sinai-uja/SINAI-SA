        Better than I had hoped!, July 8, 2007

After shopping around several stores and online, I bought the A630 with high hopes. This camera did not disappoint! I love the huge LCD screen that can be folded over to protect and refolded to address the picture to help produce and center a family photo or self portrait. There are several lighting options that you can use that definitely help in tricky situations. I took this camera to a Cincinnati Reds game and was impressed at the quality photos I was able to retrieve. I sat midway up in the stands and was able to capture some excellent batting pics of Griffey Jr. However, when the zoom is in full effect the camera must be held completely still in order to get clear photos. After some trial and error I was able to come back with some great pics! This camera gives very sharp, colorful pics almost everytime. It took some time to get used to the focus, which is made by holding the shutter button halfway down before taking the pic. I also used the video function at a recent party and was suprised to find that the audio came out better than expected. The video is a little grainy, but I bought it for the pictures, not the video. Although bigger than your normal point and shoot cameras, it is still an excellent buy for the quality photos that you will get in return. And at 8 megapixels I will not need to upgrade for quite some time.
