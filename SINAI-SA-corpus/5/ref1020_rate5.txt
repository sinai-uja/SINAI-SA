        Great Little Camera, December 23, 2008
        ByFatOrangeTabby (Lansing, MI)  - See all my reviews
What can I say that hasn't already been said?  This is my fourth digital camera in the span of about four years, and my first subcompact camera.  I have used Sony, Kodak, and Polaroid cameras and the Canon is by far the best as far as image quality and durability.  I love that it fits right in my pocket and I don't have to haul around a camera bag.  It doesn't weight down my purse if I want to carry it in there.  It's pink.  It's made of sturdy metal instead of plastic, like my other three cameras were.  The buttons feel sturdy and it has a super-easy user interface.  It takes great photos, and I was even brave enough to take it out of auto mode with the help of the instruction manual.  One thing I love about Canon is that instead of cramming all the different manuals (language wise) into one booklet, there is a booklet especially for English!  This means I can discard the other book and only have one small manual to put in my camera bag. I suggest going to a store and handling it a little bit before ordering to make sure it isn't too small for your hands.  I have larger hands and it seems to work OK for me, but I can see how some people might not like the size if they are used to a larger camera.  It is always a good idea to look at electronics in person before buying, but the prices in the stores were much higher than Amazon.  I was not able to see the camera in pink in the store, so I was a little concerned that it would be too pink or not pink enough.  It ended up being a great color, not so pink as to be annoying or to stand out.  It doesn't look like a toy.  Macro mode is excellent, and battery life is great.  I love that it has image stabilization built right in because it means that I have fewer blurry images to delete.  A perfect camera to carry with you everywhere!
