        The bulge in my jacket pocket., November 23, 2007

My other camera is a Nikon D70, which is a hunk of iron around the neck. This one is a sizable lump in my jacket, but it's always there. It always works, takes inexpensive batteries that I can buy at most stores, and takes excellent photos. I thought initially that the swing-out screen was just a gimmick, but it has proved to be amazingly handy. My only complaint is that it isn't pretty. It's sort of like a crowbar in that regard. It isn't stylish, and it isn't the smallest camera you can get, but it has all the manual controls that I need and it gets the job done.
