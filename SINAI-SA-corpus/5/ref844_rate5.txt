I absolutely LOVE this camera!!! It's so tiny, so easy to use, and the pictures are absolutely gorgeous. The camera itself is beautiful, too. The zoom function is great and so is the image stabilizer. There are all sorts of great effects, including fun ways you can play around with color, enhancing certain colors, or shooting in black and white or sepia. You can also make sound recordings and video recordings. I've had a few cameras and this is the best one by far, even better than a much fancier expensive one  I bought earlier this year.I have only one complaint, which is that the User's Guide is disorganized and hard to understand, with pages referring the reader to other pages so many times that it's dizzying. However, the camera is so easy to use, so intuitive, that this should not hold anyone back from getting this fantastic camera.
