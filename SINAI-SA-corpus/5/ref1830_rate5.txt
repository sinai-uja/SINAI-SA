Easily the best 10 megapixel digital SLR. Unfortunately, the JPEG quality isn't what it should be, so it's best to shoot in RAW and export later, especially since the quality of the K10D's RAW images is so wonderful. The kit lens isn't great, but it's great for a kit lens and proves to be a versatile starter. As a whole, the system is great for amertuer photography but extends beautifully into professional photography with the right accessories, making it a great investment for those new to photography who want the possibility of exploring it further. I couldn't be happier with it.
