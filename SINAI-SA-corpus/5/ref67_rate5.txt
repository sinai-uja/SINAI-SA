I bought this camera very recently to replace the Olympus Stylus 820 that was frustrating me with its image quality.I've only had it for a few days and already I am very pleased with the purchase.  Lots of features, great picture quality with outdoor and indoor shots.   The AS 590 IS cost me about a third of the price of the hunk-o-junk Olympus Stylus 820, but the quality of the photos I've taken is far superior.  I'm still experimenting with it. My husband, who's a bit of a photography buff, was pleasantly surprised at the features and the photo quality!  I'd definitely recommend this camera!
