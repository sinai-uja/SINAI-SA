Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Pink) Purchased this camera for my wife. It is her first digital camera. I set it on automatic and she takes great pictures. It is small enough to be carried in her purse with an extra battery. I put in a 2GB SD card so there is plenty of storage. Always having in with her has encouraged her to regularly use it. When I don't take my larger camera, it becomes our primary camera. It has enough manual setting to fit most situations and the IS is a great feature. I definitely recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for a smallcamera that is easy to use and takes great pictures.
