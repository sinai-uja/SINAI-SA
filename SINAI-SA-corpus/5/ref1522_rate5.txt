        Awesome camera, July 25, 2002

I just bought the 5700 after using a 5000 for 8 months. When I bought the 5000, I found four things I didn't like about it: Not enough telephoto, flash sensor in bad location resulting in severly underexposed flash photos, on/off switch a little difficult to use, and the lens cap had to be removed in order to turn on the camera. The 5700 corrects all of these things with up to 280 mm (35 mm equivalent) maximum focal length. The on/off switch is just like the one on the 5000 but it is easier to turn. Both the 5000 and 5700 seem to be the same camera as far as features and quality are concerned. The LCD monitor on the 5700 is a little smaller but it is clear and sharp. The 5700 has an electronic view finder which I was concerned about before I was able to try it out. It is just a miniature LCD monitor and it is surprisingly good, even in low (relative) light conditions. Only one monitor can be on at a time which saves power consumption. It is a little deeper in size than the 5000, but that's necessitated by the long focal length of this camera. I love using this camera. I highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix 5700 camera.Update after 3 months.  I recently took my 5700 and my N80 with me on a vacation to Colorado and Utah visiting nat'l parks.  I like the electronic view finder very much as it displays what the picture will look like with any adjustments I have set, i.e. exposure compensation.  I never took my N80 out of its bag.  I took over 600 pictures and I was extremely happy with its use and its results.  This is one mighty fine camera!
