        excellent camera, fully manual control..., June 1, 2004
        ByNicolas Castaneda (Santiago, Chile)  - See all my reviews
this is my first digital camera, and the first attemp to use it was frustrating, there were so many buttons, and so many menus to explore; then after an hour reading the manual, I learn how to use all the controls and now I taking pictures like crazy, probing all the features, wich by the way are endless. Anyway, the best choise, outstanding quality in every picture, somewhat noisy, nothing too important to care anyway, and tons of options for every situation.At first the shots may seems a litle oversaturated, but with a few settings being adjusted, it's perfect. the RAW format offers you a great amount of data to work with in graphic programs, such as photoshop (its fully supported in photoshop cs).The 8x zoom it's of great help. and the digital 4x zoom has his benefits too. The memory card it's not enough for this machine. Buy a 256mb or more, and make sure you get one with fast writing speed in case you're planning to go RAW.Finnally, the Nikon warranty it's international, so it's perfect for those who don't live on the US, or travel very often.
