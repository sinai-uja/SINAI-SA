I will update my review as I learn more about it.  But straight out of the box I love it so far.  Easy to use, the pictures I have taken so far are great quality, and it takes much quicker shots than my Sony Cybershot DSC-W90.  Happy so far and there is still so many things to test on it.......like the waterproof aspect.
