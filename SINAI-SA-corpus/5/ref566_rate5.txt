This camera is excellent. As a first time digital camera owner I find this easy to use, although I have not taken the time to utilize all of the features. The LCD display is 3" and can be viewed from a number of positions as it flips out and rotates, depending on your preferences. It also closes in for storage which keeps the screen clean when not in use. The quality of the shots have been very good and the viewing of the shots taken can be zoomed in. Portability is just fine for me. I am afraid that I might lose something that is much smaller. Both my children have Canon Powershot cameras and seem to be happy with them as well.
