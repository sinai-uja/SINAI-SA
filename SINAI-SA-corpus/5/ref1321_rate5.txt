        Would buy this camera again!, February 15, 2009

We purchased this camera (our first digital) in 3/05 for our Alaskan cruise.  We are very inept photographers so we wanted an easy to operate point and shoot camera that would take wonderful pictures.  This camera does it all and 4 yrs later we would still buy this camera!!  We actually took some of our photos from Alaska and enlarged to 18x20 and they are fantastic.  Used it many times while moving on inland boat tour to see whales and the boat was rocking big time but the photos are amazing.  The zoom is great, there are several different setting for scenery, portrait, night time, sports but they are super easy for a novice to use and get exceptional photos.  Never had a single maintenence problem with it either.  It comes with a rechargeable battery but we rarely use it preferring to use reg AA and carry lots of extras.  Digital cameras tend to zip through batteries so we always carry extras!  Also if you are brand new to digital cameras you will love this one, it's very user friendly.
