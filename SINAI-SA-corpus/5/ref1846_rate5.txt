Pentax K10D 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction and 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 LensLast year, when on assignment in Switzerland, I used several models of digital still cameras. I carried along the K10D, carefully testing thefirst "shake reduction" I was ever to try.Usually, I am a stickler for steadiness. Since my first days as a workingprofessional, it was always a must to employ the use of a tripod - notonly for longer exposures - but also for general shooting. Humans holdingcameras can almost never be quite as steady as a tripod or other camera stand. Think about it, our heartbeat causing pulse and cafeine shake inour hands is nonexistent in a tripod. People do not always stand steadilyand firm.My tests included handheld images with the shake reduction,  tripoddedimages without the shake reduction, and even handheld images without theshake reduction, all cases using manual exposure settings ranging from1/60th to 1/1000th sec., making notes as the images were casted on the23.5x15.7mm CCD.There is not enough room here to detail the hundreds of exposures madeduring the three-days testing. Therefore, it shall suffice to say that the K10D with its CCD-shifting shake reduction system allowed me to makesharper pistures with three different lenses. Comparing the images madeon the tripod with those handheld using shake reduction there is not anynotable difference at 16X. Of course, one 6MP camera I tested, which did not have image-stabilization was used solely on the tripod, and images from it were as sharp as the handheld 10MP camera (not deploying shakereduction and in similar lighting with auto-exposure.)Other characteristics observed: The AF points on the viewfinder are redand illuminated for easy visibility. The LCD display is large and sharpand visible from a wide viewing angle. The DUST REMOVAL syatem is quiteeffective. It actually shakes the CCD for dust removal.The menu is not difficult to understand. The controls are splash and dust resistant and the cabinet parts and retractable seem to be nicely fittedtogether.The K10D had a good feel in my hands. The dials and buttons are all justabout exactly where they should be for ergonomic placement.In the final analysis, the camera, in my judgement deserves five stars.Robert Caselnova, photographer and owner of Cas Photo Studio & Camera Shop
