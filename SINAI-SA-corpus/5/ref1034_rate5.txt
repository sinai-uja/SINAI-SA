        Great Camera!, December 16, 2008
        ByC. Bethke (WI)  - See all my reviews
Just purchased this camera as a replacement for an older HP camera we have.  I have to say that I love this camera!  We read about the great reviews for it on Amazon and it was also ranked very well by Consumer Reports.The camera takes great photos at night.  We were in NYC over the weekend and I am so impressed with the crispness of our photos.  Both the daytime and the nightime photos look great.We are only amateurs photographers.  I like that this camera is very small and can fit in your pocket.  It's not much bigger than our cell phone.  We made a great decision.  It is the best camera we have owned.
