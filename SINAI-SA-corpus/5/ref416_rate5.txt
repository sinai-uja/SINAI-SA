        ByGarFar "digital newbie" (Nashville, Tennessee USA)  - See all my reviews
This is my first digital camera but I was amazed at house easy it was to figure it out without even looking at the manual. So I consider this camera to be quite user friendly and the picture quality is impressive. I would recommend this camera to anyone.
