I'm no professional- just have a couple of toddlers and love to take pictures of them.  The object in motion setting is great to take pictures of them with, and the auto setting also takes very good pictures as well. It zooms in great to get close up shots of them from a good distance- they don't even know I'm taking their picture.  I use the great, clear pictures for scrapbooking, printing and displaying, and for sending to relatives through email.  I'm very happy with this purchase!
