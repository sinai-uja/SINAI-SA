        A Very Easy Camera to Use, August 29, 2007
        ByCARME (Brooklyn, New York)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera in July, 2007. I inserted the batteries that they came with and used the camera during 2 weddings and a vacation, taking over 300 pictures. I was very impressed by that. The pictures are very clear and sharp. I use Shutterfly which says the pictures can print up to 20x30! I haven't had the chance to try other features, I mostly stick to Auto, with and without the flash.  It is truly an easy camera to use!UPDATE--Aug, 2008--I recently just used the video feature on the camera for the first time and it is amazing. The picture is clear and crisp and the sound quality is excellent. I was very pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this camera to anyone. It is always in my purse and I use it often.
