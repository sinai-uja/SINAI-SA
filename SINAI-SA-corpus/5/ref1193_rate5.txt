        A great camera!, January 5, 2008
        Bymelissajme "melissajme" (USA)  - See all my reviews
I got this camera for Christmas and was impressed that I was taking pictures literally within a minute of charging the battery.  It's so easy to use, you don't even really need a manual, the joystick and control panel are very intuitive and simple.  Even easier than my old APS camera! I had resisted upgrading because I saw so many people struggle with "programming" their cameras - the user guide for my Dad's Sony is 50 pages - yuck, too much hassle!  But this is about as point-and-shoot as it gets.However, I became trepidacious after reading the negative online reviews of the camera.  So, I took about a gazillion pictures to test it: self portraits, people, cats, close-ups of the detail in my Christmas decorations, indoor, outdoor, daytime, nighttime.  I used as many of the modes as I could.  I choose a couple dozen representative shots for printing (NOTE:  I don't print my own, I upload them for printing at my local Walgreens).  I was more than happy with the results: all the pictures came out beautifully, far exceeding my expectations.So, as a camera for normal use (vacations, holidays, friends, family  I still miss a few shots of my cats (they're not overly cooperative...), but not any more than with any other camera, 35mm, APS, or digital, that I've ever had. However, I don't have children so I can't comment on how appopriate this camera is for catching sports and play all the other kids' action.I haven't used the video much, but to be honest, I considered that more of a novelty in a camera in this price range. If I was looking to shoot quality video, I'd expect to pay accordingly.  To me, that's the kind of advanced feature that needs some input from Consumer Reports.I think this is the perfect camera for the casual photographer and/or the technically-challenged.  I'm very happy with it and can't wait to start scrapbooking all my new pictures!
