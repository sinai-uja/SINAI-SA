        Excellent Choice, January 9, 2009
        ByNellis Silverio "Rock On" (Allen, USA)  - See all my reviews
I had already ordered a camera for my kids to take pictures for about $34 less than this one. However, I decided to explore a bit more on what was out there, since my first choice was based on my budgeted price. I read the reviews about the camera and immediately cancelled my order and ordered this camera. I was not sure about the size of the camera because when we go to parties, I do not want to be invenience with a bulky camera.  The reviews however were stronger than my bulky problem. To my amazement, I do not have a bulky problem, the camera is small, compact, light, it takes amazing pictures. I love the face view finder feature, I do remember reading about it on the description, but I was hoping this camera had that feature, and I did get it. By the time I came home, my 12 year old already had inserted a 4gb memory card (purchased seperate) and created a movie dancing with this friends, the picture was amazing. I love my camera, I love the quality of the picture, the quality of the video, thinking of give it to my niece for the 16th birthday. Oh, the battery is lasting for a long time, I am still waiting to change the battery and a replace has not been necessary. On my old digital camera, we had to, had to replace the batteries every 20 pictures or so. thumps up to Canon for producing a great product for someone on a budget and thumps up to Amazon.com, received my camera one day head of delivery schedule, Great job
