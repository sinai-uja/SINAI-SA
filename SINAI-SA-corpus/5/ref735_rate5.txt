        Absolutely love this camera!, July 13, 2008
        ByE. Darnell (Columbia, SC USA)  - See all my reviews
I moved from an older Kodak Easyshare camera to this awesome camera. It takes amazing pictures no matter what, and has a setting for almost everything (you just have to take the time to figure out how to use all of the different settings). It is a perfect size to carry with my in my pocket and seriously always takes good pictures- even if it is an action shot. Sometimes it does seem like there is a little bit of a delay when taking a picture, but that really doesn't bother me at all because its worth it for the great pictures. The only slight problem I have had is getting my pictures to my photo editing application on my computer (I have a Macbook so I'm sure it would be fine on Windows), but I eventually figured it out- it's just kind of annoying. But besides that, this is by far one of the best cameras on the market for a GREAT price- I am thrilled to have it and definitely could not go back to any other type of camera. Canon is the best!
