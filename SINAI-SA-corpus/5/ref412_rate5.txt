        Point and Shoot.....easy as 1, 2, 3, July 7, 2007
        ByWayside Park "Micki" (USA)  - See all my reviews
What can i say about this camera that i picked up at Office Depot for some 4th of July picture taking, i was impressed. First off, taking pictures on this thing is a blast because it is so user friendly to use that i did not even bother reading the instruction. The viewer does a fine job showing you the shot before THE SHOT! I even try some video shots and those come up very nice too for such a compact camera and it is so easy to hold your hand onto. I have a Kodak easyshare before and this one is clearly heads over heel a better camera as for as ease of use and high quality pictures. Just point and shoot letting the PowerShot by Canon handle all your picture taking needs.You will be impressed!
