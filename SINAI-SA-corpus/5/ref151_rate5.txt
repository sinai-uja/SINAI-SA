This is a great camera.  Beginners can use the auto focus mode or you can learn how to use all the different features.  Either way it takes great pictures.  It fits nicely in my hand and the viewfinder comes in handy when it's too sunny to use the monitor.  It's a plus to have the user guide completely in English (there's an additional one in Spanish).  I'm looking forward to improving my photography skills.
