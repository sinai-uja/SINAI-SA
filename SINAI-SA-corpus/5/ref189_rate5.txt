I had purchased an A580 a year ago and I was very pleased with the pictures. I was so pleased with the A580 I purchased two of the newer model the A590IS - one for my daughter and mother or Christmas.  The pictures were great.  My mom who had not used a digital camera before took great pictures Christmas day just using the Auto (point  shoot) setting.  She was very pleased with the pictures.  I would recommend purchasing the Canon Batteries, I purchased the Canon CBK4-300 battery kit.  The batteries have a significantly better life than Energizer or Duracell rechargeable batteries.  I would also recommend a high speed SDCard. My daughter also used the movie mode which worked well in available lighting.  The camera flash doesn't have the option to turn it on during movies. So unless you purchase a video light you can only use the available light.  I purchased the Sunpak UC-VL compact video light which works independently of the camera (must be turned ON and OFF manually) but this assists in taking movies in low light.  Overall, I would highly recommend this camera.  I have also purchased an S5-IS for my personal use and because of my satisfaction with this product I felt confident to purchase Canon products again.
