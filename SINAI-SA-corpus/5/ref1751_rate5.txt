I have been looking into buying a DSLR for some time now. I based my decision to purchase this DSLR over others because of my previous positive experiences with PENTAX film cameras. I am particularly happy with this camera. The included lens is versatile, though not very fast. It's included on-camera RAW + jpg processing is nice to have, even though I own Photoshop I get a kick out of being able to adjust my photos right on the camera (to some extent). The camera's weather-tight body makes every opening feel very solid, good quality. The focus does seem to hunt a bit in certain lighting situations, but it is not too great an issue. The only thing I wish this camera had was the ability to time bulb exposures on its own. Since I have not purchased a remote yet, I have to hold down the shutter and count the seconds when I am in Bulb Mode. (Manual exposure only lets you expose for a few seconds.)
