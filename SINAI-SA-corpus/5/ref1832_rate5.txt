        Love this camera!!, December 26, 2007
        ByLeslie Sue (San Angelo, TX)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera because I have an older Pentax 35mm SLR that I love.So far this camera has lived up to my expectations.  I can swap lenses between my 35mm and this camera and it works a lot like my 35mm.  There are a lot of features that I still have to learn, but my first impression is that I will love this camera as much as the 35mm I have had for almost 8 years plus I will have the advantages of no film to buy or be developed.  I am already hooked on this digital camera and hopefully I can take a photography class at some point so I can use it more effectively.
