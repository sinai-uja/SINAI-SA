        Great for small items in close-up, too, July 5, 2008

I bought the Canon SD1100 primarily to shoot images for online auctions and craft store listings. This meant small glass images shot at close range, indoors using natural light. I've been delighted with the Digital Macro setting, which rendered these hard-to-shoot images in very good quality (see samples in the Image Gallery). The image quality is clearer and crisper than those I've seen in other sellers' listings on those sites. I also don't have a steady hand: the image stabilization worked like a charm.It took me a bit to wade through all the icons and instructions in the manual, but I was shooting images I was very pleased with by the second day of use. As others have noted, the memory card Canon includes only holds a few shots -- I'd recommend buying a higher capacity card the same time as the camera. But other than that I'm very happy with the camera -- my first digital.
