        Best Olympus Stylus yet, June 24, 2008
        ByEric BVD "Eric" (San Francisco, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
I've owned a few stylus over the years due to their durability.  This one is the new and best yet even offering 3.6x Wide Angle Zoom and a much nicer image quality then past models of the camera. Feels like a tank, have little fear of damaging on adventures do to crush proof features.  Just plan a lot of fun to use to.
