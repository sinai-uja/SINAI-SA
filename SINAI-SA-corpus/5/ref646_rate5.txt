        Great camera, reasonably priced!, June 12, 2007
        BySusie  - See all my reviews
I am one to really review and investigate a product before I purchase it.  We have had previous Canon digital cameras and as always Canon has upgraded and comes through with a great product.  I bought this as a starter camera for my son and it has proven to be easy to use.  The picture quality is good and there are many other options/settings that we have yet to investigate and try. The flip screen is amazing.The two things that I would even slightly comment to the negative are: the memory card and focusing.  As with all digital cameras, the memory card that comes with the camera is small.  You would be well advised to buy as additional memeory card with your purchase of the camera.Also, focusing at very far distances takes some getting used to.  As you focus the image blurs then clears and sometimes blurs again before a final clear.  It is important to make sure the image is clear on the LCD before you click the picture.  After a weekend of picture taking we got used to this.As always, even after surfing reviews and pricing, Amazon was right on with reviews, the best price and very quick shipping.I am very satisfied with this purchase.
