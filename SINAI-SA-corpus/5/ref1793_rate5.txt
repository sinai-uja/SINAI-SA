Wow! I just opened the box, and I'm in love with this camera already. I decided to get serious about photography about three months ago and have been shopping for a dSLR since. I've owned Sony, Nikon, Minolta and Canon Point  I also looked at the Sony A100 for it's in-body shake reduction. I wanted four features: in-body Image Stabilization, 10MP, a tough and durable body, and under $1000.I looked at the Sony hard, but in the end declined because it felt cheap. I never liked my Sony or Minolta P rubberized plastic in all the right places. The menus and buttons are thoughtfully arranged and placed and operation is smooth.I love this camera! I'm an amateur photographer but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know this is a great dSLR.More later after I take a few shots over the weekend.
