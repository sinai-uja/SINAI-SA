        ByKenn's comments "Kenn" (Texas)  - See all my reviews
This camera has met every need of our family in our picture taking and videos.Pictures are crystal clear.  Typical easy off load by cord or memory card of pictures and videos to any computer or photo program.  We have 4 computers with a different photo program on each one.You do have to read the manual.  This is not an out of the box, point and shoot camera.  There are many many features available, and I recommend rereading the manual after three months to find out which of the many features you have not used, but could be using.Price was fair, normal cost for this good a camera.My wife has used it extensively and loves it.We our "senior citizens" therefore if we can master it, anyone should be able to.Very pleased.I recommend that you purchase a larger memory card than the one that comes with the camera so you will have plenty of storage space.
