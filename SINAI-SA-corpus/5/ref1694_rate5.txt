        Vacation Camera, June 16, 2008
        ByRobert M. Unruh  - See all my reviews
I am aware that the reviews rate this camera inferior to others.  However, if you want a camera that you can use anywhere, this is the camera for you.  it take great underwater movies and I am quite satisfied with the Quality of almost all the shots I took.  I took pictures in the water of a tow banana boat that I could not let go of more than one hand and they turned out great. Of course I didn't know that until after the ride.
