I actually happened upon the A630 in exchange for an A620.  I am totally please with its performance thus far.  This camera was purchased as an underwater camera w/ the optional underwater housing. My "A" camera is a Canon Rebel XT & I would have to say this is almost comparable & easy to use for the high-end amateur.  The preset mode for "kids/pets" was perfect as I took photos in a tour van through New Orleans.  Not one of the pictures came out blurry. Other preset modes are: snow, fireworks, underwater, macro (which took great shots), and other.  I would definitely purchase this camera again. I will update this review after I take the camera diving.
