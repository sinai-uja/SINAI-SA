I am in love with this camera.  My last camera was also a Canon Powershot, which I bought 5 years ago.  Not more than a day after I got this new Canon in the mail, I was telling all my friends and family how much I am enjoying it.  It's small and easy to stick in a pocket, but the larger view screen makes it easier to compose shots and check the results.  The stabilized zoom is one of my favorite features.  I've caught some fantastic shots of my four year old that I never would have been able to get on my older camera.  The image stabilizer takes the shake out of the action shots and removes issues that crop up from wind or just your own hand movements.  My pictures are coming out with better quality and higher resolutions (so I can enlarge whatever I want).  Finally, the battery life in these newer models is amazing.  I have taken nearly 300 pictures in the last week and never had to recharge the battery.  I purchased a second battery from Tech Fuel and with the two put together, I don't think I'll need to be worried about having my battery charger on me all the time.  I am still amazed that this great camera was less than $200.  I couldn't be more satisfied.
