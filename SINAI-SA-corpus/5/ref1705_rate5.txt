If you want a good overall camera and don't expect the quality to be similar to your SLR, you'll like this camera.  It takes better pictures than alot of point-and-shoot cameras I've seen and the underwater feature is a hoot!  I haven't tried dropping it yet, but it's completely waterproof.  I'm very satisfied.
