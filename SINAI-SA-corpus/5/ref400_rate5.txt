        Amazing camera value!, September 7, 2006
        ByHiram Grant "just call me Sam"  - See all my reviews
This is one of those nice cameras that's so well done, it's easier to talk about what the camera ISN'T, rather than what it IS!  This camera is not a small, shirt pocket camera, and might be a bit bigger than a woman would wish to carry in a purse.  It's not a super-tele camera, but it does have a respectable, bit longer than average 4x optical zoom.Using the camera, it has a good weight and feel for average sized hands.  The use of AA batteries helps keep the cost down, and has it's own advantages, although some may prefer the longer life charges of Lithium-Ion batteries (I do).  General, controls are well thought out and easy to use.  The zoom is nice and smooth.For those that prefer an optical viewfinder, Canon is probably the strongest supporter, and this is a better than average viewfinder, although it does not have a diopter adjustment.  But you'll probably never use it with the tremendous 2.5" rotary screen.  Yes, there are 3" screens on the market, but this dwarfs anything on a hinge!  It is a great aid in composing photos at low, high, or other odd angles (photos you simply didn't take before).  Another feature that gets high praise is the flex-focus system.  Today's AF cameras do a decent job, but occassionally, they just don't hit on the right focus point.  With the flex system, you can determine which point to use.  This is simply great for crowded rooms or nature photos where the subject may not be the closest item within the focusing areas.Control for this price point is very good indeed.  Multiple "scene" modes make it easy for the novice (ok, or sometimes lazy pro), while the semi-auto and manual modes give even experienced users all they need.Simply put, this camera could have easily been priced $50 to $100 more.  The only real competition is the A640, $100 more, 10 meg, and a bit more attractive black finish.
