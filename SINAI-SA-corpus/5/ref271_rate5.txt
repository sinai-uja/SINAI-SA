I just love my new camera! I got it for Christmas and after years of using disposable cameras I am just thrilled.  Took lots of pictures at Christmas and this camera is so easy to use.  I love the red eye reduction for photos in front of the tree.  I have just now started uploading them to my computer, very easy to do, and have been pleasantly surprised at how good they've turned out.  I just use the auto setting with red eye reduction and have gotten some awesome pictures.  I would definitely recommend this camera.
