I love this camera! I purchased it right before a Curacao vacation and didn't have too much time to figure it out beforehand. I found that it was easy to figure out with a little help from the book. At first I was afraid to taake it underwater but then I took the plunge!  The pictures came out wonderful. We were snorkeling and the colors of the fish came out true. You need to watch were you place your fingers beause it's easy to put over the lens. I would recommend this item!
