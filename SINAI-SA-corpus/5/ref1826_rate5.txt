        pentax k10d vs spotmatic, January 25, 2008
        ByJohn T. Gordon (Tucson, Arizona)  - See all my reviews
If you are a lifetime 35mm photographer like me you will love the pentax k10d.I used the Pentax spotmatic F for nearly 40 years & didn't want to let go of the film technology,but this digital version is like magic.It does have one automatic setting you can use to start out, but you will soon leave that behind & take control of everything yourself.I also bought two books to help me figure out the "magic"...the "lantern" book by Peter K. Burian and the "everything" book by Yvon Bourque.Both books are very helpfull. I was going to use my old lenses but have already bought a new more powerful digital lens.The old stuff is going on e-bay. great camera.........jtg
