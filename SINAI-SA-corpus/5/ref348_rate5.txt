The Canon A590 IS is a great fun toy, an excellent image capture tool, and a fantastic instrument to learn most of what there is to learn about digital photography. Both beginners and advanced photographers can definitely make great use of this camera. And all this for an unbeatable price. How to convince Canon to keep on refining this already magnificent product.
