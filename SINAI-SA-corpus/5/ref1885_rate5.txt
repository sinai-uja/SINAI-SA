        Fantastic camera!, July 5, 2008
        ByBrad (Norman, OK)  - See all my reviews
I'm new to dSLR photography, moving up from a terrific point  easy to quickly change settings.-Great image quality overall, even at high ISO!  It does take some learning to produce the best results, especially if you are not familiar with things like aperture, shutter speeds, exposure compensation, etc.  Of course you always have the auto mode to fall back on, but I try to avoid this as much as I can - trial and error with the other settings seems to be teaching me a lot more about the camera and photography in general.Con:-Automatic white balance is rather poor when shooting indoors.  This seems to be true of other SLRs that I have used too.  The different settings (fluorescent, tungsten, etc.) can help here, but indoor lighting can still be tricky, especially when light is coming from two different types of bulb at the same time.  My advice is to take a few shot at different white balance settings and see what looks the best to you.  Also, a gray card is very useful for setting manual white balance, which in my experience has been the most accurate and pleasing to look at.-No backlight for the top LCD screen.  A minor annoyance.But at least this camera has a top LCD, as the entry level Canons and Nikons and others do not.-No live view.  Not really an issue for me at all, though I could see why others would not like this especially if they are used to point and shoots.I know there are many more things that can be said about the camera but these are just a few which I have noticed so far.  All in all I think I made a great choice buying this Pentax.  It takes wonderful pictures and is really a joy to use.
