        Excellent DSLR at a bargain price, April 28, 2008

I previously owned a Pentax K100D.  I decided to step up to a DA* lens and wanted a body to match its weather sealing and SDM motor.   The K200D is the perfect prosumer DSLR.   It has all of the great features of the K100D Super (the K100D with dust removal), plus many more.   The 10.2MP sensor takes great photos.  The construction is solid and the dust/water sealing clearly visible on all doors.  As with the K100D, this model uses AA batteries, a feature I love.  Paired with a couple of sets of NiMH rechargeable batteries (I have 2500 ma Sonys), you are set for over 1500 photos.  Also included, built in support for wireless flash operation with the internal flash as master (the K100D required an external flash as the master).Overall an excellent upgrade from the K100D, and a bargain compared to the K10D from which it gets its CCD.  I highly recommend it for prosumers and entry-level professional photographers.
