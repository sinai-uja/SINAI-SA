After much research and comparisons I decided to purchased this camera for my daughter as a Christmas gift, she absolutely loves it. She is taking pictures of my 2 year old grandson all of the time now and says the pictures come out great. Can't beat this deal for the price and value. Another great purchase I found on Amazon. So far I haven't been disappointed by any of my purchases through Amazon. Thanks again!!!!!
