I just bought this camera last night and I had a few hours to play with it.  The picture quality is fantastic indoors and outside.  The macro setting is really nice.I was looking for a small camera under $300 that has great picture quality and movie quality.  I found it!  The SD100IS is the best choice, and it looks very cool.  I bought mine in brown.
