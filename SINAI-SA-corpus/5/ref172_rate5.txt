        This is a good camera., December 3, 2008
        ByKent A. Russell (Middletown, IN)  - See all my reviews
The camera body is plastic but it is substantial and feels solid.  Be sure to get 2500 NiMH batteries as they will last the longest.  The manual says you should get approximately 450 shots with a fresh set of NiMH, 2500mAH batteries and approximately 200 shots with regular Alkaline batteries. The batteries are quick to change and a separate coin battery in the camera keeps the date/time and other settings from falling out so you are up and running in no time.  Some reviews have said you can't zoom when shooting video but that is not the case. Granted, you won't have the digital zoom capability, but that has not been an issue for me.I like this camera and I'm pleased at how it works a feels.  For the price, it is, by far the best deal out there.
