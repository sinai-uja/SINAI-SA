        Excellent DSLR, January 12, 2008
        ByJojoo  - See all my reviews
This is my first DSLR. I've tested several DSLRs form Canon, Nikon,  such as Canon XTi(400D), Nikon D40x, D80. But none of them is better then K10D. The Canon 40D is one of the competitor, but the price of 40D set is much higher then K10D kit. Also K10D has BODY SR, which means you do not empty your pocket to buy those lens with IS.
