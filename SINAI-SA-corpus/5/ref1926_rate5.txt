        Couldn't Be More Pleased, February 3, 2009

The Pentax K200D is a pleasure to use. I purchased it for my wife, who has not been happy with the point-and-shoot digital cameras we've been using for the past few years. She cut her photographic teeth on a Pentax SLR many years ago and has missed using it. This camera has brought my wife back to photography in a big way. The feel of it, the comfortable and sensible controls, and the accuracy and stability of the shots has her (and me!) taking shots more frequently. The images are great, with lots of detail and depth. When we want to zoom in for sports shots, we swap out the lens that came with the kit for an old zoom lens that's more than 20 years old. That compatibility ensures we keep the value of our old gear while we get fantastic photographs.For old-school photographers like my wife and me, this DSLR is a perfect fit.
