It is a excellent buy and value for money DSLR.I am using it for last 3 weeks and its really simple to use if you follow the instruction in booklet.very few buttons and most of the setting can be handled easily.if you do not know about aperture control and other SLR terms pl. help yourself with a book like DSLR for dummies (buy it any book store around USD 25 ).IT helps.The most important things is the optical Viewfinder, and is very good and comparitvly bigger view as compared to other leading models.pl. do view thru the OVP while comparing cameras bcos this is what you will be doing in almost any picture you are taking with a DLSR.Also see that while holding the camera by your eye ,are you able to navigate  and change aperture and shutter speed etc and can easily see the values in the OVP display.second important thing that it has a button called GREEN button. the purpose is that if you are in the full manual mode or AV /SV modes you can press this button to set the camera to the values which Camera considers appropriate. and then you can make manual corrections ,like slighly changing the aperture or shutter .So , this button removes the Guess work out.It also helps you to tell what camera thinks about the settings and you can comapred with what you will be setting.Camera holds good in big hands and i was very comfortable with the Grip.I used energizer rechargeables and did not face any problem even if i am using flash all the time.Flash gets ready  fast for the next action.Apart form that it has all the stuff which most of the  SLR have.[...]
