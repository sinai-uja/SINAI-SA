        Kodak CX7430/Printer Dock Bundle, July 7, 2005
        ByTown Without  Pity  - See all my reviews
I am new at digital photography, and I was looking for something easy to use, yet a camera that took great pictures.  This absolutely fits the bill!  The way the camera works is similar to any Kodak film-type camera - just point and shoot.  It has the same features my film camera does, in that you frame your subject, depress the shutter button halfway to focus, then shoot. It has an auto setting that is useful for most picture taking, fill-in flash, zoom.  It's extremely easy to review any pictures taken, and delete them immediately or save for later.Not only does it take clear, sharp pictures, but it also has a video feature that was amazing for an inexpensive camera.  The instructions contained in the booklet were precise and easy to follow.  Great for beginners.The printer dock is also easy to operate, and is certainly nice to have if you want to print a few pictures here and there at home.  The cost factor is a little high, at approximately $.64 per print, so it would be more cost-effective to have them printed at a drug store, etc.I've loaded the software onto my computer in order to upload the pictures to view and/or print.  I had no problem with the software after loading, and it is very easy to use.I would not hesitate to recommend this model to anyone just learning to use a digital camera, or someone looking to upgrade, for that matter.My next purchase will be a bigger memory card for the video feature I plan on using!
