        A great value, July 14, 2008

I've owned at least 3 digital cameras of progressive MP technology over the years.  I think this Canon Powershot is a great value for what you get, whether your a snap-shotter or a more advanced user of digital cameras.  This camera has just enough features to make people like me dangerous, but not too many that you are overwhelmed.  The modes/settings are easy to configure and with a little practice, you will be taking some great pictures.A lot of people think that the greater the MP, the better the quality of the picture.  This is not true.  I was looking for a camera that I can take quality photos with and share them over the internet; I do not need a professional camera that will produce poster-sized shots.  And for my purposes, this camera is perfect!
