        Bygls1974 (Milwaukee, WI)  - See all my reviews
When I bought this camera, my intention was to have a camera that I could easily upload pictures onto my computer and I was not disappointed. I first, like most smart shoopers, did my research on this camera and it had great reviews, so I thought why not? I also did a search thru Yahoo for digital cameras to see what they might have because I did not want to just rely on the comments by Amazon customers(no offense). This little camera had some of the highest reviews and that sold me. It came fast and it's smaller than you might think. The software was not a problem for me and all you need to do is follow the instructions point for point. I'm a novice camera shooter so if that fits you and you want a nice digital camera, then get this one. You might can get some at cheaper prices, but this is Canon, they are know for making high quality cameras for a long time and this is another great product.
