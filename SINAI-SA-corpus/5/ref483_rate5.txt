Didn't buy this product for myself. But the person I bought it for has no complaints whatsoever. Tried to buy this camera from another online merchant but when they took almost a week to try and process the order I decided to buy it from Amazon instead. Amazon delivered where the other merchant failed!Thanks again Amazon.Regards,Joel
