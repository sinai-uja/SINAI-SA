        Great Camera - solid choice!, April 28, 2008
        ByA. Ziegler  - See all my reviews
Really debated before purchase.  I had decided to purchase A570IS and then heard this one was coming out.  Watched for those first reviews as camera was introduced . . . went ahead and bought it and LOVE IT.  This was replacement for older Canon Powershot which had finally worn out.  A590IS takes those great Canon shots - awesome detail and easy to use.  Just took tons of pics of daughter's Junior/Senior Banquet - they all are fantastic - inside, low light, bright light behind the subject, outside in direct sunlight. "Auto" did just fine!  Not a blurry shot in the bunch!  Glad I stayed with tried and true Canon.  My daughers both have Nikon L's and they noticed how much more detail my Canon pics had - and they were looking at them on the 2.5 in screen!
