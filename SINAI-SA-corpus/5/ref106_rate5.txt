This is a phenomenal camera!  Photos are crisp with excellent clarity.  So many features I've had to refer to the manual on many occasions however, being a camera novice it is pretty user friendly.  I'm still adjusting to all the capabilities and excited about taking the camera when I deliver our second baby in January!
