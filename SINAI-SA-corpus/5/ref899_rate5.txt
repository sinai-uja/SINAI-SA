I bought this camera so I had a powerful, yet small camera to carry with me wherever I went. I didn't expect all the features in this power-packed little camera.It's fun to use. It's a beautiful camera. It fits in your purse or pocket. I bought a nice leather case for mine. I suggest you buy an extra battery. Buy.com has them as I write this at a very low cost. I also suggest you get an 8GB SD card. At least a 4GB.The zoom is excellent and easy to use. The surprise is the macro. It picks up the dust on my keyboard. And I can use the macro without a tripod. The stabilizer is fantastic.There are lots of reviews on YouTube, all over the Web and here on Amazon. So I won't do an in-depth review. Let me just say that you won't be disappointed with this camera.Also, should you need support, Canon has about the best support there is. At least they did the last time I used them with another Canon I had. I've not called them with this camera.I bought mine from BuyDig for $149. Shipping was free and they sent it by FedEx the same day. I got it in three days. Also got my leather case there. I recommend BuyDig.Highly recommended.- Susanna K. Hutcheson
