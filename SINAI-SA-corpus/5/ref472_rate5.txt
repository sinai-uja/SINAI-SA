This 8mp camera works fantastic, the quality pictures are incredible and its many features let me do what i couldnt do with a previous 5mp kodak camera i had before. First the screen size is perfect, very bright and clear, the mobility of the screen helps on keeping the surface of the screen protected when not in use. it takes only 1 sec to start taking pictures after it is turned on. while in video camera mode you can zoom in/out, video quality excellent. i still haven't used the other many features but so far is doing so good.What i don't like but it's not a big deal is the amount of batteries it uses (4AA) but it compensates with the lenght of battery life.
