Hello fellow Amazon.com shoppers,As there are many reviews about this camera I will keep this one short.Pros:-Great PQ-Lots of user settings, but auto settings work as good, it picks up the correct scene every time in auto mode. You will quickly understand the menu UI and different settings as they are very good described both visualy and as text on the screen.-Good VR, you don't hear or feel a buzz, which is good.-I was able to use my old ('87) 35-70 and 70-210 Pentax lenses. Autofocus works as it should razor sharp and exposure is correctly calculated.-I really like the kit lens, it is of far better quality than other brands kit lenses. It comes with lens hood and has a professional look to it. Very fast AF (way faster than Nikon!)Cons:-The included lithium batteries (AA-size) gave me 750 images instead of the 1200 images as advertised on the box. (12MP JPEG, 10%flash,little screen use). The next set were Alkaline batteries and gave me 200 shots. So stay away from Alkaline's. Make sure to get the battery grip BG3 and 2 sets of high capacity NIMH's. The camera is quite compact compared to Nikon's but slightly larger than comparable Canon's. I have large hands as I'm 6'6" and I really need the battery grip to have a good feel on the camera. I guess the body is the right size for normal people :)-The power consumption was higher with the 8GB SDHC card I used at first. Now I get about 900 images with a normal 2GB SD card and one set NiMh's GP 2700mA. I think the SDHC cards use more power, stay away from them if you don't need the capacity.All in all, very satisfied Pentax customer and feel happy everytime I go out and use it. I noticed I take the camera with me more often than I used to because it is so intuitive to operate. You are always fast enough to get that 'drive by shot' in the city :)
