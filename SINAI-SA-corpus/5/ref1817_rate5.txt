        K10D is an Amazing Value, November 30, 2007
        ByPaul Connell (ME United States)  - See all my reviews
Its mostly all been said here, but the Pentax K10D seems as if it were custom designed for migration from film or prosumer digital. I've used it for six months and am very pleased. I mostly make 10X16 prints, using an Epson printer and Photoshop.The value for the money in this system is unmatched by any other maker (not even close, IMHO). Amazon's latest body price, $530 after rebate, made it possible for me to purchase a back-up body.  Incredible for a camera with a real pentaprism, Adobe DNG, shake control, self cleaning ccd's and the build-quality of a $1,500 Nikon. But it's not a camera for the occasional user or the point-and-shoot person. It can make spectacular images, but you have to be willing to work them at least a bit. It rewards involvement.
