        Great DSLR w/ weathersealing and nearly perfect ergonomics, December 31, 2008

This was my first DSLR and it's been a great experience.  It uses the same Sony sensor as the Nikon D80/D200 and if you shoot RAW, you get effectively the same results for much less cost.On top of that, you get weathersealing so you can use it in the rain or snow or dust w/o issues.The body feels solid unlike the plasticky XTi/XSi/D40/D60, and even the D80 to some degree.Only nits are I wish it had a faster flash sync speed and predictive AF (the AF-C is really AF-S run continously).
