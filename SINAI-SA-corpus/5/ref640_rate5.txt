Super Fast!  Camera is great so far....haven't really played with it yet but I will tell you the shipping was wow!  I ordered this about 10:30pm on a Saturday.  Got an E-mail on Monday saying it was shipped. Wednesday I had it in my hands.  How fast is that!!!?  Plus it was "free shipping"!!!I did my research on this camera and it seems to be perfect for my use.  Took a couple of photos and they are spectacular indoors and out! Price is right too.  I amost got the A640 but couldn't part with an extra $100. just for 2 more mega pixels when 8 will do fine.  The software is easy to install and my photos downloaded fast to the computer.  Also this camera lets you take pics pretty fast in a row using the flash so I considered that as well.  It works just like all the 5 star reviews say it does.  I have had a Kodak EasyShare and that failed after 3 years so this is a great upgrade.  I recomend this camera for it's ease of use, cost and great product support (software)  Check out all the great reviews!  All these people can't be wrong!
