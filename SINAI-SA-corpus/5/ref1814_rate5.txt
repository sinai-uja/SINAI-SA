I made the transition from point and shoot (Canon S2IS) to DSLR with the Pentax K10D and I am so happy I did! I am a complete novice in the DSLR imaging world, but am quickly learning what it's all about and this camera makes it easy. I was debating between this and the Nikon D80, but chose this camera because it offers the built in Shake Reduction, the weather seals, excellent image quality and much more at less than the Nikon cost. The camera feels solid, it has a nice grip and a Green Button that definitely helps me capture the shot when I need the correct settings quickly.
