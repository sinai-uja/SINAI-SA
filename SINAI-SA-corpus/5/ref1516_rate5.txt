        Absolutely Awesome!, December 17, 2002

It's a very big camera in a very small package! Gorgeous images, lots of features, and it has the options and control available in a professional camera. What a great travel camera. Let's face it, if the camera's a burden to carry or to shoot with, the pictures won't get taken. Nikon has solved that problem with this small wonder. I'm a picky professional photographer, and this camera has returned the fun quotient to my travel shoots.
