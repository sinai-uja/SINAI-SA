        Canon PowerShot: A Great Choice, August 16, 2008
        A Kid's Review
When I first received the Canon PowerShot A590IS for my birthday, I knew I would never receive a gift as nice as this one again. The camera has lots of cool features, including 16x digital zoom and up to a ten-second delay picture. One of my favorite modes is the movie mode. Unlike my previous camera, it has a built-in microphone for movies that will go as long as you want them to.The only thing I think you should be careful of is the batteries. My father and I realized that regular AA batteries wouldn't last very long. You have to use long lasting, good batteries and I'm always sure to bring extra batteries on a trip.Want to put the camera into movie mode but don't want to use up the batteries? Press display a few times and the screen will turn black, a handy feature that doesn't drain the batteries.Overall, the camera is a great choice for future photographers who can't afford a big expensive professional camera. 5 stars!
