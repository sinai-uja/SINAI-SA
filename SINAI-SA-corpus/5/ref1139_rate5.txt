        I LOVE THIS LITTLE CAMERA, December 11, 2005
        ByK. L. HANSON (North Dallas, Texas)  - See all my reviews
This is a great little camera.  It is SO EASY to use.  The photos are great.  I was totally stuck on my 35mm camera until I found this.  35 mm is great but I wanted to be able to preview my photos to make sure I REALLY got the shot.  I also wanted to be able to delete the JUNK without paying to have it printed at the photo shop.  I previously owned a first generation digital camera.  The photos were mediocre because of the low megapixels (a big reason why I would not give up the 35mm).  I am extremely happy with the quality of photos from this camera.I also bought the printer dock which recharges the battery.  This set works out really great for scrapbooking.  I can easily print off another picture if I need one to fill out a page.  I have even taken the camera and printer to a friends house to scrapbook. I print as I go.I agree others reviews.  I do not care for the software that comes with the camera.  I prefer to use the Windows XP software.I highly recommend this camera.  It is easy to use and the pictures are great.  What can I say, I don't think I have used my 35mm since I bought this.  There is no reason to.
