        Great little camera--4.5 stars, January 26, 2009
        ByLetta (St. Charles, MO USA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this primarily for vacation-style snaps but found out it has the possibility to take artistic photos as well.  The close up capabilities amazed me.  True, the 3X optical zoom is the bare minimum, but I had luck using the digital zoom without compromising photo quality.  The different settings like 'sunset' or 'aquarium' really make a difference and I've only just begun playing with 'color swap' and the manual ISOs.My only gripe is that the battery seemed to run out about twice as quickly as promised in the manual (about 150-175 non flash pix or 75-120 flash pix) but the included charger only takes 90 minutes so that wasn't too big of a deal.  Also, this camera only comes with 32 MB of memory so you'll need a bigger card.I recommend taking 15 minutes to skim through the posted photos people took with this camera to get a real idea of its capabilities.
