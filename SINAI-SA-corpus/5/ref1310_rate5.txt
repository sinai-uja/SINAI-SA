We are extremely pleased with our purchase.  The camera is very easy to use.  Very intuitive.  It takes great pictures.  We get compliments on our photos all the time because the colors are so vibrant and the resolution is so sharp.  This was our first digital camera.  We love the idea of being able to take as many pictures as we want and we can delete what doesn't turn out.  I shopped around before I bought it, and I felt we got the best deal from Amazon.  Definitely a wonderful camera for the price.  And I also love that you can add lenses/filters to it.  The Kodak Easyshare software makes the picture easy to edit (if you want) and share with others.
