        Great Camera, Easy to Use Right Out of the Box, June 28, 2006
        ByGreg Robertson (West Quincy, MA)  - See all my reviews
Having recently had a bad experience with a Nikon digital camera, but with a long love of my old SLR, I had a lot of trepidation about this purchase.  All of that went out the window in about 15 minutes, though, as I began to figure out the Z740's controls and take some pictures.  It's very easy to navigate between different types of shots, the view screen is plenty big without getting in the way, and the pictures -- close-ups, wide shots, and distant zooms -- have all come out crystal clear. Over time, as I've explored the manual a bit, I've also found a lot of other cool features I hadn't expected.I also like the fact that it gives me options as to how to upload the picture files to my computer, or directly to a printer.  (The Nikon did not offer such options, had hard-to-understand controls, and suddenly died for no apparent reason.)  Kodak also offers a number of helpful extras to work with it -- additional download ports, cables, tripods, and so on -- all comparable to whatever else is out there in the marketplace.Whether you want one for everyday snapshots, higher-end specialty shots, or the option to do both, I can highly recommend the Kodak Z740.
