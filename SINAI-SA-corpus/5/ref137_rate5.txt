        Great Value, hard to find features, December 8, 2008

I have had 2 of the previous iterations of this camera, and bought this only because I had dropped my earlier version and broken the internals of the view finder. I shoot candid shots in group settings and wanted a camera with a viewfinder that responded quickly when the shutter is pushed and used AA batteries. This does far more than I can do and is perfect for what I use it for.
