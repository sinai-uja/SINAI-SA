        Great little camera., January 7, 2009
        ByJ. Richards  - See all my reviews
My wife wanted a small digital camera for Christmas that she could keep in her purse.  This camera fit the bill.  I am impressed that it takes such good quality pictures and the amount of custom features it has on it.  I initially had difficult capturing good candid shots of my young children because the red eye reducing lamp was turned on and it delayed the capture long enough for my children to make goofy faces or turn away. When I turned it off, there was no delay but there were red eyes in the photo.  I guess that's the price I have to pay to not have the red eyes.  So far I don't have anything bad to say about the camera.  It works well and I get great results (but my wife wants it back so she can take pictures).
