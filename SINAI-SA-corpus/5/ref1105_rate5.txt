        Improvements over SD1000--, March 13, 2008
        ByGood_Person (NY)  - See all my reviews
I took a lot of time to review this camera before buying. I DID NOT buy the camera at this time, so this is a PREVIEW - not a review.Why am I writing? Because I see so many people here describing the SD1100 as an upgrade to the SD1000 - with the only differences an added megapixel and image stabilizer - So I would like to bring to your attention the rest of the differences and improvements, which can help your decision.The SD1100 has many improvements over the SD1000. It has FINALLY a battery meter which is a recent welcome addition in Canon cameras. It has the "LP" mode for video, which doubles the time you could record video, at almost the same quality (640x480). So in the SD1000 on a 2gb card you were limited to 16 minutes, and in the SD1100 you can have 32 minutes. That's also a welcome addition for Canon which only let's you record on uncompressed AVI format - not MPG like so many others. You can still not use the OPTICAL ZOOM when recording video.The zoom range is also different. The SD1000 was a little more "wide-angle", and the SD1100 zooms in a bit more.The face detection technology is also improved, by applying the strength of the flash according to the face it is recognizing, so it's should not overexpose.For you guys who still doesn't have a clue what the SD1000 was bringing new, let me repeat in short (of course everything is included in the SD1100 as well). Face detection technology; in camera red eye correction; 2:3 guide for 4x6 prints (you know where it's gonna get cut-off); settings and menus are much better designed than previous canons (you could see more selections on screen); and much more.I would also like to mention that pcmag.com has a review on the new SD1100, but they say that the older SD1000 (which was a "editor's choice" since arrival) have better picture quality than the newer SD1100 - So that the new 1100 is not worth upgrading from the SD1000.Hope my information will help someone.
