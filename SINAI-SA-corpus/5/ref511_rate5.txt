I really like this camera. It has many features of my larger and bulkier digital SLR. I like the stitching mode. The picture quality is very good. Night shots at low light performance is admirable. It is not exactly a "slim" type camera but does fit into your pocket. It servs well as camera for the starter (my wife) in the "auto" mode, or for the more experienced in the sp, or ap mode. The details in 11 by 8 prints are excellent. I am very happy with this buy.
