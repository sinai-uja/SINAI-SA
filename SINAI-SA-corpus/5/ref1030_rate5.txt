        Awesome little camera, December 21, 2008

This is everything I wanted in a sub compact camera....you tell the camera how good a picture you want to take and it does the rest...even the video comes out clean and clear with ease.  Taking pictures in dark places, the pic comes out a little grainy, but it's still there.  Before taking any picturs, you tell the camera what you want, the kind of light your in, etc.etc. and it does the rest.  Pics are clean, clear and beautiful.  I'll never own another camera unless it's a subcompact and canon makes the best
