I'm a mom that was looking to upgrade her 3mega pixel camera to one with a higher mega pixel to get better pictures upon enlargement.  I was debating whether to spend more to get the highest pixels or go with the Canon A590IS with 8MP.  I decided budget wise to go with the A590IS.  Boy was I glad I did...this is a great camera!  The pictures are so clear and there are so many options on this camera if you want to be creative and change how your shots come out.  I think my 15 month old is becoming a "Ham" now that mommy always has the camera in his face!
