        Beware of dealers and battery claims!, December 13, 2006

Luckily, I didn't fall off the turnip truck. I ended up ordering my K10D from Broadway Photo, after having cancelled an order at Century 21 Photo. They BOTH tried to up-sell me a battery, Century 21 claiming that the camera didn't come with a battery at all, and Broadway trying to tell me that the one that comes with the camera only lasts for 20 minutes. The batteries they wanted to sell me cost $140, which is not surprising since they also charge $400 for a 2 gig SD card! Pentax rates their included 750 mAh batery at 500 shots. If that's not enough, you can get a 1700 mAh battery on eBay for $17.95.
