I have to edit my review because I am having problems with this camera.  I will save my positive comments below, though.I love this camera so much.  I have recommended it to everyone I know.  Well, now I am regretting that because I have only had the camera since July (4 months), and I am getting Lens Error messages. When you get a lens error, the camera beeps and the lens will not come out.  Canon's website does not have any solution for this on their website, but I found a lot of people had the same problem when I searched the internet today.I am supremely disappointed because this camera is so great in every other way.  I am now telling everybody I know not to buy this camera because I don't want them to experience the same problem as I am currently having.-----------------------------------------------------I have a Canon PowerShot SD550 camera that I used for a few years, and I was ready for something new.  I love Canon cameras.  The buttons are very user friendly.  This camera was rated highly on Consumer Reports.  You can take pictures quickly with this camera, which is a big plus for me.  I also love some of the things you can do in the color settings.  You can choose one color as an accent color, and it turns everything else black and white.The flash works really well...you can take a picture in a dark area, and still get a great picture with the flash.  And it's not one of those flashes that blinks 500 times before taking the picture!  Plus, you get to pick between several colors!!  This is a great camera for the price!
