        Even I Can Use This Camera, February 9, 2009

I hate technology and I hate reading manuals, but I love pictures of my kids.  So when my Kodak digital camera finally died (what a piece of garbage that thing was), I did my due diligence before deciding on this camera.  It holds a charge for a really long time, it takes and stores tons of pictures after a cheap memory upgrade, it's easy to download and the quality of the pictures themselves are outstanding.  I mean, my kids are so gorgeous it's hard to get a bad shot - but seriously.  This camera is the perfect purse camera for anyone out there who wants to take good pictures with no fuss.  And yeah, you're kids are probably good-looking too and with this camera you'll have oodles of evidence to prove it.
