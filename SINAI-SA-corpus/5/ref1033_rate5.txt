This is a great camera, I mean for 150 something dollars this is an awesome deal.The package and shipping was excellent. Once I opened the product I fell in love with it.The camera feels strong (not cheap), it has great functions and the pictures have a very good quality. I think you get everything you pay for and little more!!! If you have a doubt about this camera, forget about it... Strongly Recommend...
