        Oustanding for the size/price, June 26, 2008

I own an earlier rendition of the Digital Rebel, and as most SLR users know, sometimes you just don't want to lug all that gear around. I live in NYC, and I wanted a compact camera to keep in my messenger bag for any random photo opportunities that came up throughout the day (and didn't want to drop the cash for a G9). The SD1100 really exceeded my expectations. In fact, I took it along with my Rebel on a Caribbean vacation, and I found myself shooting with the compact almost exclusively (and I was shocked at how well it dealt with the strong lighting you run into on the beach.)It suffers the typical compact limitations (lots of noise at high ISO, tendency to blow out highlights in high-contrast shots, underpowered flash, etc.), but the SD1100 still performs WAY better in all of those categories than any small camera I've ever used. Even though it's a completely automatic affair, the various settings provide enough control to shoot in a pretty much any condition, and they're accessible enough to adjust on the fly. I love my SD1100 and absolutely recommend buying one -- it provides lots of flexibility and produces pleasing photos at an excellent value.
