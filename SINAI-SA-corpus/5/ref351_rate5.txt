        Great performance for a great price, December 15, 2008
        ByB. A. Anderson (Tamil Nadu, India)  - See all my reviews
I do documentation fieldwork, so I wanted an inexpensive backup camera in case of any problem with my Panasonic TZ5. I chose the Canon a590 because of the great reviews, and because I had been impressed by the performance of my parents' Canon a570. I hate to say it, but I'm happier with the Canon a590 than with my Panasonic TZ5. I particularly like the manual controls on the Canon, and the possibility to set the flash strength. It looks like I'll use the Canon as my primary camera, and keep the Panasonic TZ5 as a backup in case I damage or lose the Canon.I bought the Canon a590 for $119 on-line from Best Buy, and it included a 2 GB SD memory card. I bought Radio Shack's NiMH rechargable AA batteries, which are the best rechargable batteries I've ever used.I highly recommend the Canon a590.
