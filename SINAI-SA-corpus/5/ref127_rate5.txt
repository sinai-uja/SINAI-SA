I have had this camera for about two months. I love it! The picture quality is great. Out of 700 photos taken, only two came out blurry! This is impressive considering how hard it is for me to stand still. I love the stabilization this camera is equipped with. The image quality is great. I took a Christmas photo of my children and everyone though it was professional. Also, video quality is satisfactory for a camera at this price point and I can record up to an hour as long as my memory card is large enough to store my video. I haven't toyed with the additional features very much, but I'm sure they are nice to have as well.
