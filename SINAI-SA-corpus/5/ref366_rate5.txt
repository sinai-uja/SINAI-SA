Great camera! Does tons of stuff. Will take me quite a while to learn it all. However, it is very nice to see and know that it will not only do what I'd hoped, but a whole lot more as well. It's a very good camera. Amazing actually.Pricing was excellent. I'd rate it a "Best Buy" as of Jan 2009.
