I've only had the camera for one day...It was delivered this morning...Seems like a great camera for it's size...Colors and details are awesome...There should be an included case, but there is none...32MB memory card is tiny...Only holds 15 wide screen shots...You'll need to order a small case for protection and a bigger memory card!
