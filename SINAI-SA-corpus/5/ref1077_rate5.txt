I bought this camera after having dealt with many other digital cameras and this one is the best one yet! The picture quality is beautiful and I don't have to wait a lifetime for the flash to work as I did with other cameras. It fits great in your pocket and is lightweight. It has the face focus squares and the zoom works wonderful. I would recommend this camera to anyone.
