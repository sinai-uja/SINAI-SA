As everyone else has said, this camera is great; small, cute, works perfectly. What I want to add is that the software that comes with it is amazing. The camera has a function to help you line up panorama shots, and the CD that comes with the camera has a program called PhotoStitch that will stitch the peices together into a panoramic picture. It works great! The program senses by itself where the pictures should line up and puts them together; for far away views you can't even tell where the pictures were stitched together. Its amazing.
