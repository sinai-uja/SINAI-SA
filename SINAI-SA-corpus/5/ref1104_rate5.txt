This camera is a great companion to my Rebel XT, but I am getting to the point where I may abandon the SLR for certain trips, due to the crisp image quality and greater portability of this model.The PowerShot IS excels in good light, with its ISO 80 setting providing great colours. At the opposite end, ISO 1600 is a useful setting to have, however the images become quite grainy, and if your subject is moving, you are unlikely to get a crisp snapshot in low light.The large LCD screen makes composition easy, and the quick power up and power down makes for opportunistic shooting.I am also a big fan of the timelapse feature, whereby you can take videos at 1 or 2s intervals and the output is stored as an AVI file at 15fps. One adjustment I will have to make is with regards the battery life, and after using a digital SLR which can go days without a charge, I've found I need to keep a spare battery on me to keep the energy hungry LCD screen in business.A few of the features are a bit gimmicky, such as the colour swapper, but for the price, the 8MP images pack as professional a punch as you could want from a sub $250 camera.
