        It's a cheap little camera, but great in that class, January 13, 2009

We love this camera - takes excellent shots.  Sure, friends with $700 cameras have better shots, but this does an excellent job for casual pix and snapshots.  Only gripes are slow time to recharge flash, and it drains rechargable batteries quickly (the flash does this more than the camera itself, I think).
