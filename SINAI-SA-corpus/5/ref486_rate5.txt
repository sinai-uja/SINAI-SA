Absolutely great! You get what you pay for. I also have a Canon Digital Rebel, but I use this PowerShot as my secondary camera. It's just great. Sometimes I wonder why I bought my Digital Rebel. Photos are of great quality and the different modes and functions let you play almost as free as you can imagine. May not be a professional camera, but perfect for amateurs like me.
