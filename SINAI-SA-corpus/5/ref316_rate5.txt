        Awesome Camera for the Price, January 7, 2009

I purchased this camera when it was on sale, and so far, it hasn't failed me. It's a great camera! It arrived in perfect condition, has many different settings, and --for those who don't use cameras often-- has an Auto setting. The only thing you'd need to buy after buying it is an SD card and camera case. The SD card that comes with it is really small and only allows one to take a few shots on it before it is full.
