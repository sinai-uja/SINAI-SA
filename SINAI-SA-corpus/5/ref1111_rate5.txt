        Great Purchase, January 13, 2009
        Byrikat (Bay Area, California)  - See all my reviews
I am a high school student who is interested in photography (amateur status) and takes pictures for yearbook. I wanted a solid, attractive camera that could take fast shots, adjust to lighting quickly, and had a good auto setting, freeing me up to compose my pictures fast and effectively, rather than wasting time making sure the camera focused and that the flash worked correctly. This camera filled all those requirements, and it is the best purchase I've made in a while. I research a lot before I buy an item, and I bought this trusting that it would meet my high standards. It did! And the blue aluminum casing is both pretty and durable. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small, light camera that takes fast and great resolution pictures. For an incredibly low price, too!
