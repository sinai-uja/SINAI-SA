        15% price increase in a month? , February 22, 2009
        Byshecapn  - See all my reviews
I marked this item for purchase but apparently the month too long that I waited caused the price to rise 15%? Wow - with stores going out of business left and right, maybe we should be rethinking using Amazon who can randomly slap a 15% increase onto a product in a matter of weeks.
