I Just purchased this Kodak Z740 and love what it does, the zoon is unreal..I cannot believe it..but I have a question and cannot find it in the manual or anywhere....DOES THE LENS EVER CLOSE? BECAUSE MINE DOESNT...when i turn the camera off the lens goes back into place (inside) but the SHUTTER, the little black thingy inside, will not close or shut or whatever...???????ARE YOU SUPPOSE TO CONSTANTLY CARRY THAT COVER PIECE FOR IT TO KEEP IT PROTECTED OR IS THERE THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MINE???????? i dont want to return it as it was the last one and i got a screaming deal..please anyone that has one, let me know your thoughts..ease my mind and tell me that's the way the camera is or something...ALSO:, one more question, is this the correct dock to get if i want one touch transfer, Kodak Easyshare Camera Dock (Series 3) ????they sell them used on Amazon for about $[...]????ok, thanks for viewing, hoping to hear from someone..[...]
