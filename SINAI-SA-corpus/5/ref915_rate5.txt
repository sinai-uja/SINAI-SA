I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas.  We havn't used it a lot yet, but the few times we have, we have been pleased.  I bought a Kingston 2GB SD memory card for it and it works very well.  I noticed that the memory card was made in Japan.  And that's a plus in regard to quality.  Also it was formatted already so that was easy.  I set it for Super fine sharpness and can get 550 pictures with it.  That is more than enough for general snapshot use.
