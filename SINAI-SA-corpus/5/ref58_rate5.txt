        Upgrade your old camera now!  With this one!, January 29, 2009
        ByTimothee H. Howland (Nashville, TN)  - See all my reviews
Anyone using a 2 or 3 year old inexpensive camera, should spend a hundred dollars to upgrade to this one.  It is fantastic.  And I have a Canon 40D with 7 lenses...Not much more to add to great reviews here, such as from RLSd.But count my 5 stars in. :-)
