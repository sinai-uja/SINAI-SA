        Very nice macro capability, January 3, 2009

I am particularly interested in macros (close-ups), and wanted an easy, tote-along camera for hikes and other nature explorations.  Couldn't be happier with the A590, and for the money, it can't be beat.  See sample macro image of winterberries that I uploaded.  Focuses down to 2".
