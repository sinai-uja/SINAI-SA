We had been looking for a new camera to replace our 3mp nikon and were ready to get the 870 when the 1100 came out.  Needless to say we are very happy that we went with 1100.  It has done a great job taking clear, non blurry images, has a nice amount of settings to help with more creative shots.  The size is simply perfect, incredibly small but just the right size to allow for comfortable picture taking.  I especially like the small indent on the left face that fits your finger perfectly.
