        A Great Point and Shoot, July 6, 2008

After taking some time to research this camera, I went ahead and purchased it. On a recent trip to Cabo San Lucas, this camera survived a 2-1/2 to 3 ft. fall onto a marble floor, vibrations from an atv ride, the dust from said atv ride, and the rinse off of the dust. I also used it in the rain at a baseball game, something I would have been hesitant to do with a standard point-and-shoot. The pictures and video were of very good quality just in the normal settings, as I haven't gone through all the settings yet. High marks to Olympus for this camera.
