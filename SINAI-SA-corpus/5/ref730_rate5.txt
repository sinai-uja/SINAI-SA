        I'm no expert, but this is a great camera!, September 2, 2008

I'm not a photographer but I have a newborn and a toddler so I take A LOT of pictures and each one is important to me.  Photo quality is great, first and next shot delay is fantastic (which was a major concern because the toddler doesn't wait!)and the functions are all intuitive - who has time to read the manual?!Also, just got a new laptop that runs Vista and there were no problems with compatibility.If you're looking for a super-easy, tiny  point and shoot camera that works well and takes great pics, go for it!
