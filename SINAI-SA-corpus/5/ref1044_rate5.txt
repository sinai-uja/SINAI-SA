        Love my new canon, December 16, 2008

I bought this camera as an update to my old canon that only had 2 megapixels.  I use it to photograph jewelry which I sell online and it takes beautiful shots in natural light on macro mode.It's also super easy to use and download to my mac computer.   One negative is the low memory card that comes with it. I had to buy more memory, but it was still the best deal that I've seen this holiday season.I would definitely recommend it.
