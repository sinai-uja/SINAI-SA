I got this camera for my husband on the occasion of the birth of our 2nd child.  Picture quality is excellent and he has even shot some videos.  Easy to use and download to computer.  His only complaint is that it is small and easy to misplace!  It is amazing how far camera technology has come.  My old camera (canon powershot 4 years old) is much bulkier!  Canon lenses are always high quality.
