I just recently had a baby and we were using my husbands old Kodak DX4330 (3.1 mega pixels). After making prints we were not satisfied so we decided we needed a better but afforable camera. And after researching I found this to be the one. And I was right on! Great quality pictures! Easy to use! Awesome flip screen!! Just be sure to get a bigger memory card!
