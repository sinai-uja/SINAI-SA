        Great Upgrade, January 6, 2009
        ByA. Hardman  - See all my reviews
We bought this camera to replace our old Powershot that had the dreaded E18 error.  The new camera cost less than the repair would have.  We are so pleased with the improved features, in particular the quickness with which the camera focuses and takes a picture.  In addition, the camera finds and focuses on the faces in a picture, et this does not create any delays.  We have very many blurry pictures of our infant son because we had to take them without the flash.  Now, we can capture the moment we really want, the way we want it to look.
