The AS590IS is a great camera for me. I have had a number of 35 mm cameras and one digital camera. This camera is easy to use especially for those that are not really high tech. There are functions that a person can do manually if they understand the camera and how to use the functions. There are a number of settings that are easy to select and use. I would recommend this camera it is a good value.
