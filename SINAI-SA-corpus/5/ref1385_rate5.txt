        Best Camera Ever, December 25, 2005
        ByJ. Wright "Webstar" (Hawaii)  - See all my reviews
I received the camera today.  Took several pictures and printed out the highest quality photos.  I will never go to a photomat again.  This camera is great for anyone who doesn't want to study a huge manual to begin using the product.  It is so easy to use... I guess that's why they call it Easyshare.  I LOVE IT!!
