        As always, Canon makes best Cameras, June 14, 2008
        ByR. Malik "jollygood" (monroe, NJ United States)  - See all my reviews
I have owned cameras of Sony Kodak and Canon brands. I bought the 12mb Kodac camera and it was a biggggg dud. It took ages to capture any image. Then I got the Canon 570is and it was just wonderful. I upgraded with the 590IS for myself and gave the 570 for business use. The pictures are crisp and sharp. The camera works pretty fast. Uses AA battery hence no worry of loosing power in midst of action.Cons-- I cannot imprint the date on the fotos. May be this should be added as an added feature for newer upgrades.
