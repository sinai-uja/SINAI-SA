What started as a quest to buy a mini-camcorder, ended with the purchase of this Canon. My husband wanted something small that he could shoot video with ... I couldn't get past the horrible photo quality of your average camcorder. This Canon does is all with aplomb, even in low-light conditions. Not bad for a camera that can get lost in a pocket.
