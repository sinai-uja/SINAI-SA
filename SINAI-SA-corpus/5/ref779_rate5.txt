We have two kids in college.  Bought my daughter a Pink one.  My son was so impressed by it that he also received a Silver one for Christmas.  We took a short road trip to Enchanted Rock, TX, and they both put their cameras to the test.  Everyone was impressed when they saw the pictures and the videos we made.
