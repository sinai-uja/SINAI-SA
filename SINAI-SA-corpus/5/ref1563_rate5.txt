Bought this a little over a week ago, just after testing my underwater housing for my Canon S30 and finding it was leaking.  We were leaving for five days of snorkeling in Cozumel and I wanted to be able to take underwater pictures.  The Stylus 1030SW really fit the bill.  Got a 2GB Olympus card and spare battery.  The card was more than enough capacity and I was really pleased with how many shots I could take on a single battery charge.  Over the 5 days I took over 800 photos and one battery usually lasted most of the day, even though I had the camera on most of the time I was in the water.  I'm sure I surface dove to 15 and 20 ft a number of times, so, the 1030 was a better solution for me than the 850 would have been.  I also really like the wider angle (effective 28mm).  Camera worked great underwater and for other vacation shots.  I usually turned the flash off underwater since shots taken with it would have lots of spots from reflection off all the little bubbles and stuff in the water, but, got some real nice fish & coral photos anyway.  It can be tough to see the LCD in real bright conditions, and, the black is just paint (one time when getting out I got trown by a wave and slammed the camera into the coral bottom scratching the paint but otherwise the camera was uneffected).  I'm very impressed with the quality of the photos this little camera is giving me, the range of adjustments, and, after a fairly short learning curve, the ability to adjust the settings pretty easily.  I also got the floating strap which does keep this heavy little beast from going to the bottom if you happen to lose hold of it.  I'm very pleased with this camera so far and looking forward to using it a lot, particularly taking it along biking, hiking, camping and other active outdoor uses.
