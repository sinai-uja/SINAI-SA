        Canon A630 Review, April 11, 2007
        ByOak Ridge, Tn  - See all my reviews
Both my new Canon A630 and older Canon A80 are satisfactory in all respects. The automatic  feature on both is flawless when the simple press half way/hold/compose/shoot directions are followed. The lens quality on both is outstanding. The reason I bought the A630 was to increase the  pixels from 4 (A80) to 8 (a530). It turned out to be be helpful only with enlargements exceeding 8 X 10 inches. All smaller were perfect with the A80. The most significant advantage of both cameras is the ability to shoot over the heads of people in front of you. The snap out swiveling viewing screen allows you to hold the camera high over your head, look up, and still perfectly see the scene you are shooting
