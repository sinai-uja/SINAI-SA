        Excellent camera for family use!!, July 5, 2008
        ByMichael J. Frederick (San Antonio, TX)  - See all my reviews
I bought this as a replacement camera for my wife, and so far, both of us would agree that it was well worth it.  The camera is very easy to operate, produces stunning pictures for such a small camera, and is just plain fun to use.  It has several modes to work with, but we mainly stick with just shooting images.  We currently use a 1 gig card to store the pictures, and so far that has been more than adequate.  For those that shoot a lot of photos before emptying the card may want to get a bigger one though.  For casual home use though, the 1 gig has been more than adequate.  The only nitpick I have regarding the memory card is that putting it back in takes a little extra effort for someone like myself who has big fingers.  It's a very minor thing and should not be a discriminating factor as the camera overall is superb.  Canon tends to produce some very nice small cameras, and this one is no exception.  So far my wife really likes it and has been using it quite a bit to shoot general images she probably would have passed on with her previous camera.  Like all gadgets, read the directions first as that will make it easier using it.  Overall, we're both very impressed with it and would highly recommend it to anyone needing a small and dependable camera that takes outstanding images.
