        Simply Great!, December 22, 2007
        ByConcerned Consumer  - See all my reviews
I won't even try to write a review of the camera to top some of the extremely helpful ones already here, but hopefully a helpful hint to "newbies" to dslr like me, and a comment regarding a very pleasing discovery.  First, the hint - I bought this without a case/holster initially, but you really do need one to protect it.  I found that the Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 works great for the K10D with its supplied kit lens.  Although the camera/lens does fit into the Lowepro Topload Mini, it does so just barely, with no room for the strap.  So if you're looking for an inexpensive bag, the Topload Zoom 1 works great.  (I'm putting this comment under the camera because I figured if you're looking at the K10D, it's best to report on a bag under the camera's heading, than randomly under the bag itself, which would take a lot more work to find!).  My comment has to do with the Pentax's battery.  I've been incredibly impressed by its ability to hold a charge.  I bought the camera over a month ago - charged the battery when I got it, and it's STILL, one month later, indicating a full charge, despite having been in the cold, and I've taken about 300 pix (about 1/2 w/flash)!  I'd worried about charge "shelf life" because I sometimes go for several weeks w/o using a camera, then, with my P&S, find the battery dead when I need it.  This camera, after months of pre-purchase comparing, definitely offers the biggest, best bang for the buck!  You won't be disappointed!
