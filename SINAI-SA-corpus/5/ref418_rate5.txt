        Great Camera, May 9, 2007
        ByM. Lonsberry "Karate grrl" (Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI)  - See all my reviews
I am still learning how to use this camera, but overall the pictures I have taken thus far have been excellent. I intentionally bought this camera to challenge me to learn more about digital photography and so far it has been easy to learn. The only bummer was the way too small initial memory card. What a waste of resources and a method to make you part with more cash. But overall, excellent camera.
