This camera is fantastic. I've dropped it more times than I can count, and it still works like it did when I first got it. I've used it for over a year now, and I've taken millions of photos, away at college, home for Christmas, parties, at the pool, on my trip to Australia, up in Lake Tahoe, college group retreats, concerts, dates...everywhere I go, the camera comes with me. It fits great in my purse. I know it looks big, but I haven't had any problems taking it anywhere. It doesn't exactly fit in your pocket, but since you can flip the back panel around, the screen stays protected. I love how clear the pictures are, too, and all the shooting modes make it fun to play around with the camera in different settings. My friends love that you can flip the screen out- it makes it easy for them to take photos of themselves without making somebody else do it, and it's great for taking pictures of my boyfriend and I when we go out. Sometimes I have issues with clarity when I turn the flash off, but that's partially due to the fact that I can't keep my hand still long enough. All in all, the camera is well worth the money. I highly recommend it! :)
