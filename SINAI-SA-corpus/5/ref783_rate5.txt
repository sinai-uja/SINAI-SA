        Fine point and shoot, January 10, 2009
        ByM M  - See all my reviews
I bought this for my son's birthday. All I can say is WOW.  Great still shots.  And I was blown away by the video.  The video was 100% better then some of the SD video camera! This camera is a keeper. I bought a class 6 - 8 GB card. I can have 60 min of video or around 1900 pictures. :)This is my next camera.
