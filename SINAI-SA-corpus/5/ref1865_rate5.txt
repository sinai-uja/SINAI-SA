        Exact fit for old 35 mm user, June 9, 2008
        ByJ. Martin (Rancho Cordova, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
I replaced my older Pentax PZ-1p and ZX-7 35 mm SLRs with this camera. It has most of the professional features of the PZ-1p and many more auto features than my ZX-7.  The build quality is better than either one, with a steel inner frame and a weather sealed and tough, dense material for the body.  It is a good fit in my hand.  The kit lens is really spectacular, matching most fast glass primes in quality in regular light conditions.  The pictures I have taken are better than what I could do with 35mm.  Part of this is the ease of digital redundancy, but the detail of the 10.2 mp sensor is really breathtaking.  I can use all of my old Pentax lenses, even from the manual Pentax K1000 that I still own. BTW, that old K1000 manual SLR camera still works flawlessly, and is one reason I am such a Pentax fan.  The shake reduction is huge advantage over the older cameras, and since it is built into the body, the lenses are much less expensive that the Canon or Nikor equivalent. I have always thought Pentax glass is as good as the other , pricier brands.   This camera is great as a point and shoot or for more advanced users.12/16/08 The kit lens does need flash support in low light, so I added the SMC Pentax F/1.4 50mm prime.  The Pentax DA 55-300mm completes the kit.  After using Pentax k200d for 3 weddings (Pentax AF-540FGZ flash), a Disneyland trip, and some art photo work, I am very happy with the camera.  Learning the advanced settings has improved my photography a great deal.  I now almost never use the Auto settings anymore, and love the RAW+JPEG setting.  In very low light, and for macros, I turn off Auto focus.  When using older "A" lenses or manual lenses I use the M setting on the dial, and CUSTOM menu setting 23 allows use of the aperture ring.  This is a great bridge between an amateur and pro camera.
