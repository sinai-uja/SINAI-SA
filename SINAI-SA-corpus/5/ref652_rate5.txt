        Just what I was looking for!, August 13, 2007

The Canon PowerShot A630 is even better than I imagined.  I have had it two weeks and already have 237 photos that everyone is impressed with.  The quality is excellent and it is so simple to use that I am carrying it with me almost everywhere.  I had a Minolta Dimage and it was way too complicated to carry and to use.  This is exactly what I have been looking for and would recommend it to anyone who wants great photos.  Both of my college age kids got one last Christmas and so, I knew it was what I wanted in a camera.
