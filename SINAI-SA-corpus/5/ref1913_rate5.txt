Very pleased with this camera.  Already had lenses from a Pentax 35mm camera and write up said they would work with this camera.  I was skeptical, but upon receiving the camera, I found they worked perfectly.  Has large selection of various modes if you want to customize the way the camera takes pictures or it can be totally automatic.  Shake reduction is a great feature for low light situations.  All in all, a good buy.
