        Finally...easy, great pictures from a digital camera!, December 15, 2005

This is my third digital camera and I have to say that finally I have one that is worth its price.  First of all, the preview screen has great resolution; this is not something I would think of as important, but compared to my previous 2MP camera, it is amazing how much of a difference it makes in taking a great picture to have a great preview.  Also, the 10x optical zoom is what really allows you to take close ups without the picture looking like an 80's video game!  Finally, the combined package with the printer makes actually getting the pictures OUT of the camera and onto paper (and we know we're all guilty of leaving them in there forever) so much easier.  Who would have thought that all you really wanted were some 4x6 snapshots?  Yes, we all like to have a large-size of some special pictures--and you can do that if you want to with it--but every picture does not have to be a masterpiece, so use the easy print feature with this camera and remember what it was like before digital cameras when you actually got a stack full of snapshots.  If you're looking for a camera to replace film, this is the one.
