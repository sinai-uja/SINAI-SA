        Item Review-, February 20, 2009
        ByA. Shuford "ABS" (Charlotte,NC)  - See all my reviews
I have converted from the others to Canon family of cameras. With this one I have found that this particular model gives me so much more lattitude to more with technology as it is packed with this camera. Alot of features and a "great bang for the buck".I would buy again and recommend to many!Thank-you
