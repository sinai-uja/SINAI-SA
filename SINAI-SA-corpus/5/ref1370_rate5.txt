        Another great Kodak camera, September 12, 2005

Having purchased a Kodak easyshare camera for my daughter I knew the quality of their product.  However, for my purposes the digital camera with the 10x optical zoom was a better fit for me.  I recently used it to capture my son's first soccer game and I'm officially in love!  The zoom was so outstading - it was like I was standing right next to him! Plus, with the "sport" feature I was able to take multiple pictures in a row in the zoom mode.  The action sequence photos were crisp and focused.  This camera is great.  There is no shutter delay except as expected with the red-eye reduction and night mode.  My only problem is that the flash pops up whenever I turn on the camera.  Amazon sent me a second camera however the new camera also has this problem.(Amazon was excellent during this whole process - I received a new camera within 24 hours!) Kodak has informed that this is not supposed to happen - yet I'm reluctant to part with my new toy.  We took movies of a "film" my kids made and the camera worked like a movie camera with over 5min. of filming time!  I highly recommend this camera to anyone with chilren - I use it in so many different ways.
