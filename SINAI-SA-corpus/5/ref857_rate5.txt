        Canon's little powerhouse, June 26, 2008

This SD1100 might be Canon's best little digital Elph yet. The image quality is superb and the handling great. So there are not manual controls...save them for the SLRs out there. This camera does what it promises...takes great photos with little to no experience needed in the user. The image stabilization, LCD, picture modes, and the fact that it does have a viewfinder make this little camera a virtual powerhouse. The size is perfect for back pockets and the color choices are icing on the cake!
