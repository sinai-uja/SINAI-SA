I just received my EasyShare camera a couple of weeks ago.  Not only does it zoom, it has moving making capability!  This surprised me.  You can take 33 seconds of video with your EasyShare.  The picture quality is great and the camera is easy to use.  Further, the user documentation is simple to understand!Highly recommended for those of you in the market for a digital camera.
