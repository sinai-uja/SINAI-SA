        Bygerri passarelli "NH Shopper" (nashua, nh United States)  - See all my reviews
After much research, and a trip to the local camera store, I purchased this camera for my son who is taking it on a hiking trip this coming summer. Although we have not yet tested it agains the elements we are very happy with the picture quality and camera itself. Make sure you buy a floating strap for the camera if you plan on using it near/in water.
