        wonderful:  digital, but easy to use and understand, February 21, 2004

After years of happiness with a Nikon SLR, I decided to go digital at last.  But I had great fear that the camera would be like my home-heating control or an early digital watch, i.e. that you had to carry a fat manual around just to figure out how many times some button had to be pushed to make basic commands.  All I can say is, this camera was superbly designed in a user-interaction sense:  the software/hardware mix is far better that in computers.  It is all common sense!  Thus, this camera is a joy to use and far more economical than my old SLR.The quality of the pictures is also excellent, at 5 megapixels even more detailed than an analogue photo.  I have now experimented with the camera in many conditions and I must say that it focuses quickly and easily - really a joy to use.  And it is much lighter than my old SLR and so easier to carry for long periods.  About the only thing that is a problem is how fast it eats batteries - I would definitely recommend getting the rechargeable battery set.  Highest recommendation.  Though more expensive than other models, you are purchasing the Ducati of cameras!  I think it is a design masterpiece.
