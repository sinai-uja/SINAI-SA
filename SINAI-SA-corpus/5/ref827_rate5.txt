I had the SD1000 (also a very nice camera)and decided to give that camera to a relative. I bought the SD1100 and it is a high quality compact camera for a relatively low price. I like the size because I can take it almost anywhere. My daughter will be taking trip to Ireland and I bought her one as well. I have a NIKON 1200 (high end camera) but truly only pull that out for weddings or when I am taking photographs of the kids for school. This little camera was all I used for my daughters birthday party and the pictures turned out great. You can't go wrong if you want nice pictures and don't want to pay a lot of money for a high end camera (which tends to be more complicated to use if you really want to get a bang for your buck.)
