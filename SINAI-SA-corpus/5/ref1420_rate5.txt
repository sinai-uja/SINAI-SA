First off, mine came with the lense cap, neck strap, rechargable battery, USB cable, dock adapter, a full sized user's guide and a software cd. Pictures can be transfered via a USB cable or by removing the memory card and inserting in your computer/printer/memory card reader. I love this little camera and it has alot of different picture settings from sports, landscape, snow, ect. Very nice and very easy to use.
