This was purchased for my wife as a walk around kind of camera.  She uses a Nikon D70 for her "real" photography, but needed something for family activities or driving around.  So far, she has been thrilled with this camera.  The size of the camera is great.  The extra area on the right side allows for a great grip and stability.  She loves that she can hold it facing her to take photos with her and the kids.PROS:  Ergonomics, ease of use, video feature was an unexpected bonus that she uses all the time.CONS:  Battery life (caveat:  we've been using generic, non-rechargeable.  We're currently looking for good rechargeables.)  While there is a Macro feature, my wife finds it somewhat unsatisfactory as there is "bending" around the edge of the image.  It is small and not something I would have ever noticed if she had not pointed it out.Overall, we are both greatly satisfied with this camera and would recommend it to anyone (and do!!!)
