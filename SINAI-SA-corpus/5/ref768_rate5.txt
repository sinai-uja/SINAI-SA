I bought this to replace my SD110 which had no problems but was only 3 MP.  This one continues the tradition of excellence of Sony cameras.  One advantage of my old camera is the ability to use the zoom when taking video.  Battery life is excellent, but I did need to buy a larger SD card (2 GB) since the pics take up more memory due to increased megapixels.
