Have been a Canon fan for the past 30 years and was looking for a new digital camera. Read a review about the Pentax camera and coupling it with the Pentax 18-250 lens.  My wife was doubtful at first, but after using it for the past month she is convinced of the usefulness.  It does everything that I expect and more because of the antishake feature. I didn't realize what a difference that would make.  The selling point was the fact that it is the most water resistant and dust resistant camera that I know of.  For me, this was a very important feature because it will be used for outside activities.  The picture quality was fantastic for me.  The only thing I am considering is upgrading to the 20D
