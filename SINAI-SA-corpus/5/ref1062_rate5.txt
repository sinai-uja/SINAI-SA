I just got this camera yesterday after my sony cybershot was stolen. I have to say this canon model is waaaay better than my sony cybershot(although the cybershot was 3 yrs old). The canon has better features and takes better pictures. Plus you cant beat this price on amazon. I got this camera in bohemian brown, and wow it is gorgeous!!!! Its sophisticated looking. I didnt want silver because everyone has silver and the pink and blue are pretty, but wow the brown is nice. Its a deep chocolate brown with a hint of eggplant. Anyways, my favorite feature is color accent! My sony cybershot did not have that. But all in all, amazing camera for the person in their 20's who want to use it for going out or for vacations. although its fine for all ages. Dont hestitate, after so much researching this camera is worth it for the price range.
