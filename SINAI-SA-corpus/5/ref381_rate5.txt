I had a long-time digital camera fail me and I reviewed available ones in Consumer Reports to find that this one was recommended.  It was just right for me in many respects.  I like to take candid shots and really don't like a camera to take too long to come on or have too much of delay in actually taking the picture.  I have been impressed with the improvement from my 5 year old digital camera.  The pictures are simply excellent.  The image stabilization lets me zoom in and shoot without flash.  The shutter speed is reduced, of course, and I often have to take few shots to get a no blur picture due to subject movement, but I've seen very little evidence of problems with hand shake.  I really like this camera.
