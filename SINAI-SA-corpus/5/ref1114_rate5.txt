        ByTech Time "Rich" (St. Louis, MO)  - See all my reviews
I was looking in Consumer Reports and this camera got the best rating for sub-compacts.  Then when I found it discounted to $159.00 on Amazon I jumped at it.  It has been great, but you'll need to take the time to read the instructions.  I mean this camera does everything, so to really take advantage of all it's capabilities you should spend the time to read the manual.
