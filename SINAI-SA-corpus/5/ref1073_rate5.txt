The SD1100IS is, for me, a backup travel camera.  I have another much larger digital camera that serves for taking studio shots (art work) and telephoto details in scenery.  That said, I find the SD1100IS just excellent.  Get a decent neck strap so you can slip the 1100 into your T-shirt pocket (guys here) and you are all set.  The little camera is very adaptable--recent night shots of Philadelphia came out nicely.  The macro setting works well too--flower details can be recorded with ease.
