        Everything you need in one little pocket, August 29, 2008

Very portable for vacations, used mostly when on motorcycle.  This camera has all options and features that my professional grade SLR has; the only gripe is the zoom.  If you want perfect clarity, don't count on the zoom too much.  Impressive macro ability.
