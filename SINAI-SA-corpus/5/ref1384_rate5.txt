        A lot of function without a lot of weight, great value!, February 23, 2006

I ordered this camera after doing a lot of research both online and visiting local stores.  I couldn't be happier with my choice.  The Z740 camera works great and is very simple to operate, I was able to start taking great pictures immediately.  This is my second digital camera and I'm impressed with the improvements in technology over my old DC4800, particularly the speed of snapping a picture...not missing those "Kodak Moments" anymore!  The Zoom is awesome!  You need to be very steady or maybe use a tripod to avoid blurry shots...practice.  The flash is great, doesn't wash out the subject.  For me, this is a perfect fit!   The free SD card saved me some $$ as well.  I bought the Kodak battery charger travel kit at my local Target store, the camera fits well in the small bag and the rechargeable batteries are a must.I recently took this camera with me to NYC and had a blast taking a wide variety of pictures indoors, outdoors, daylight, dark, people (co-workers..moohahaha) and cityscapes.  Picture quality is beyond my expectations and most were taken in auto mode, I can't wait to explore more of the features.I have to agree with one of the "downsides" posted here, the lens cap does come off way too easily, which puts you at risk for scratching the lens, be sure to get a filter to protect it.Overall, a great camera for a good price!
