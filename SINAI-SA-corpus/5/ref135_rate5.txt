        Excellent buy on an excellent camera, December 16, 2008
        ByDennis Mosley  - See all my reviews
I looked for a new digital camera for quite awhile.  Finally decided on either a Cannon, Nikon, or Sony.  Amazon had this camera on a particularly good sale at just under $100.00.  I jumped at it.  The two models I had been looking at in the Cannon line was this Powershot A590 IS and the 110SX.  The price convinced me this was the one for me and I'm very glad I did.  I've not had the time necessary to use all of it's features but the ones I have are very,very good.  In AUTO mode it'l do most everything the average picture taker needs done and does it well.  I'm not anywhere close to a professional photographer, at one time I did have a small business taking photos, using hand models, and made quite a name for myself, but, that was in the years of 35mm and the myriad equiptment list.  I've dropped the camera bug for the motorsports bug that I made a bit of money photographing, and love the way this camera responds to all the shooting situations I come into now.  I can even use it at speed on the track, without anybody else near anyway.  It is that easy to use.  I'm impressed with the results I've gotten so far and will continue to delve into the features of this very good, small, lightweight, point-and-shoot.  The results are far better than most other point-and-shoot's that I've seen in this same megapixel range.  I understand it's the size of the sensor, and not just how many pixels it senses, and the sensor in this camera is bigger than most others.  I LIKE IT !
