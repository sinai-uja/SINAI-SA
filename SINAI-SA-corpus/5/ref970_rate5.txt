        Very practical, January 7, 2009

Although I bought the camera as a gift, I used it briefly and it seemed very easy to use. In the short period that I "played" with it I took great pictures, downloaded them to my desktop computer, and in a matter of seconds printed some great 8x10 pictures. I also took some quick videos, easily connected the camera to the television, and viewed the videos on my big screen. In short, the Canon PowerShot has many features that make it a great little camera.
