I have read some of the sour grapes reviews, And Frankly I dontunderstand. I Own this fine camera and as for the focusing in low light situations..........You have to play with the shutter button half way depressed and it works fine....And as for the photo"s they are Stellar................Buy this Camera, spend some time reading the Manual........You have to do that, You are not buying a average run of the mill mickey mouse digital camera.........Once you do that and familurize yourself with this fine machine.......You will feel totally Rewarded, I know I have..........
