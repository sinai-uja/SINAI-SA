        Love the PowerShot A590IS, January 6, 2009

I bought this camera to take on vacation in Maui.  It works great, it was very easy to use.  I just read the owners manual a little on the plane on the way over and was snapping away in no time.  A full day of taking pictures, I would get about 150 pictures with one set of AA batteries.  The color of the pictures is great and it was small enough to carry every place.  The AA battery is available every place so it was easy to keep it going.  It took an 8 Gig mem card (sdhc) so I could take over 2000 pictures on the highest setting!
