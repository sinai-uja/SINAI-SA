        Boy, am I not sorry, January 15, 2007

I love this camera.  I was switching over from a 35 mm, which I've had for 20 years, and used Consumer Report as a guide.  There are a lot of little picture-icons on the readout screen on the back of the camera, which take some memorizing to get straight, but at the same time, you can do as much or as little "fancy" as you like, and still get pictures that look really good.  This is a camera to grow with.  I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone.
