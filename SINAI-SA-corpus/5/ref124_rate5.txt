        ByRonald L. Esarey  - See all my reviews
I cant say enough good things about this camera.Great pictures,easy use,and takes videos with sound.That are very clear.Im pretty new to the digital camera thing,I had a old HP 2mp.I thought that took good picture,but WOW for 100.00 you cant go wrong,I read 100's of reviews a differant cameras in this price range,it took weeks,boy did I make a great choice.I hope you do too!!!The battery thing some have a problem with I still have the same ones that came with it in there,and bought recharge AA's with the charger at walmart for 10.00,so if the batteries go Im ready for it you get 4,it only takes 2.Buy this camera,if you dont want to spend  a bunch.
