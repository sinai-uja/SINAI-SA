        Glad I did my homework!, January 5, 2009

I did my homework when my old Samsung started going out.  I looked at the newest Nikon CoolPix, Sony Cybershot, and the Canon SD1100, and after reading the reviews on CNET and playing with each camera in the store, I decided on the Canon.  I love the features in this camera, especially the ability to swap colors and focus on one color while leaving the rest of the image b+w!  For a amateur who loves to take pictures, this camera is great.  The pictures here don't do the camera justice - the pink color is really pretty!  I'm happy :)
