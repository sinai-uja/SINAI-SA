        Great camara, January 30, 2006
        ByW. Beckles "wbeckle" (Maimi, FL United States)  - See all my reviews
I bought it after reading several reviews (other than Amazon) and the reviewers could only find minor issues.  It does not have image stablizing (like any other camera at that price) but I couldn't tell, all my images were sharp, even at maximum zoom.  A few other friends also used it and produced visually pefect images.  One image so far had slight blurr at the fringe but it's not very easy to detect.
