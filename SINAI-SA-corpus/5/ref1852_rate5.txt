With the proper lens this camera can do everything that the big boys like Nikon and Canon can do! It has so many features sometimes I have to get the manual out to remember how to use them! Its fast, sturdy, waterproof and takes great shots! I've printed out some photos so far up to 8x10 size and they are as crisp as you can get and that is using the stock 18-55mm lens that came with the camera. I have yet to purchase a quality prime lens to test but if the stock lens does this good, I have no worries. Since I already owned a previous Pentax SLR some of the lenses I already had worked with this camera so that is a bonus feature and part of the reason I went with this camera. This camera will function as a point and shoot but I would not recommend this to a complete amateur.
