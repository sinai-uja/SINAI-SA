WHat an amazing camera! The video quality is great, picture quality is excellent. I recently took this camera on a 7-day cruise where I knew I would be snorkeling and spend most of my time underwater. I was afraid at first to get the baby wet...but it handles like a pro. My advice....USE THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS!!!!! They really made a difference between shooting landscapes, on the beach, in the water etc. I dropped this camera several times  with not a single problem. it just works.... If you plan on shooting alot of video clips, I would recommend the special 2GB M type video card (it was less than $15 on amazon) I's also recommend the floating wriststrap, which came in very handy  while swimming....and yes it keeps the camera from sinking!). I can't tell you how many people were asking me about my camera...they were so envious that I could take great digital photos without some bulky plastic camera housing!Pros:DURABLE ...this thing took a beatingGreat pre-settings for different conditionsLove the thumb wheel to toggle between camera and video and the Guidebig LCD screengreat mic quality when taking videovery sleek/slim designworth every damn penny if you live outdoors!came with mini SD card adapterCons:Wrist strap doesn't tighten to wrist ( i just took one off an older camera)LCD screen is hard to see in sunny conditions ( but that's with every LCD camera)
