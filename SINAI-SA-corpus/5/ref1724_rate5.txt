        Great Camera, December 27, 2008
        ByPhotog fun "iceland photographer" (Boston, MA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera just before a trip to Iceland.  It handled the temperature extremes from being at the top of a cold windy mountain to being dunked in geothermal pools up to 104 degrees.  The shaky hand feature is wonderful for taking shots from a moving car!!!!  I would highly recommend this for any traveler.  While it may not have all the bells and whistles of a bigger SLR professional camera, this met all my needs of taking good pictures in many different situations, and is also very durable!
