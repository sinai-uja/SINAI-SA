I bought this camera/printer bundle for a friend. The battery on the first camera received would not stay charged more than a few hours.  Contacted kodak who said it was defective and to return it to vendor.  Amazon accepted the return and sent a replacement within 3 days.  Second camera is great.  Excellant pictures and the printer works great too.
