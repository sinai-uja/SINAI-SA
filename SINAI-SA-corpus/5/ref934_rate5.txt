        Fast action and great pics, January 16, 2009

I had bought a Sony Cybershot and was totally disappointed with the indoor photo quality. I returned it and bought the Canon Powershot SD1100 at Walmart for $199. Ended up returning that because it was $154 here! For $31 less than I spent at Walmart, I got this camera, a spare battery and a nice carrying case from Amazon. The camera is almost instant-on and time between pics, a BIG criteria for me, is really fast compared to Sony and Kodak camera's I've had. The pictures are great with just the standard settings - haven't had time to look around and try out any adjustments. I have a 1GB card and that seems great for pictures, although you'd need more like 4GB if you want to take any movies, too. Size is good, not too big or small and screen is plenty big. HOPING for no lens error messages!
