Wonderful little camera!  Size is perfect, can slide right into my purse.  Takes amazing pictures!  Great price! Pictures show up extremely well on screen, even outside.  Easy to use. Love the gold color. When viewing pics. you can change them from vertical to horizontal just by turning camera. Very cool! I couldn't be happier with purchase.
