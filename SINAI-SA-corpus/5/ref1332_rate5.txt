        Great camera at a good price, March 4, 2006
        ByMichael Freeman (Blanchard, OK)  - See all my reviews
I just got this camera to use "on the job"--for crime scene photography.  It takes great photos and the zoom lens (10X optical) is really good as well.Taking 5.0 MP photos you can zoom in (or blow them up) and get really good detail.  I like this camera for field work because it will take AA batteries (though Kodak doesn't recommend alkaline batteries) in addition to the lithium battery that came with the camera.The Z740 has an EVF, or Electronic Viewfinder.  With the exception of single-lens reflex cameras, when you look through the viewfinder what you see is slightly offset from what the lense is seeing.  Basically an EVF is a second LCD screen that you look at through the "viewfinder," so you're seeing the same thing the lens is.  The EVF uses less battery power than the external LCD screen, and is of course shielded from sunlight, though the external screen does better in sunlight than most cameras' screens do.As far as I can tell, the camera won't take images in RAW (uncompressed) format.  That's a negative if you're using them for crime scene analysis, but not an issue for the average photographer.  As with most digital cameras in this price range, you cannot connect an external flash, either.The proprietary software that comes with the camera is easy to use and the images download easily.  The camera is also "plug-and-play," meaning Windows will recognize the camera even without Kodak's software installed, and you can download images that way.
