my husband and i bought this camera a week ago, and we love it. i definetly recommend this for first time digital users. after reading the manual and playing with the camera, and all its settings, i am completely used to all the differnt buttons. for those who've had problems with pictures they take inside..i'm not sure what the problem is. if the lighting isn't good in your home then use the nighttime setting. or read the manual and it'll tell you the best solution. and for those who were dissapointed that it doesn't zoom while taking video, all i have to say is....it's not a video camera. i just wanted to let people know that this is definetly a great buy. and i have looked around and amazon does have this for the best price, compared to some other sites that sell it for 350 or higher.
