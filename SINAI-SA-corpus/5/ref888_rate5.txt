        Excellent, versatile camera, February 22, 2009
        ByHadar Pedhazur (New York)  - See all my reviews
My wife has loved her trusty old Canon A410 for a long time. It was literally falling apart, and she still didn't want me to replace it. When I finally insisted, she gave me two criteria:1) It had to be a Canon (because she's familiar with the controls, and the software on the PC side)2) It had to have a viewfinder (not just the LCD on the back)My wife is nearly legally blind (and still takes incredible photographs), and she insists that the viewfinder is the only way she can reliably line up a shot.In order to make for bigger LCD screens, most cameras have dropped the viewfinder altogether. That made picking the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS very easy for me (after very little research).She loves the camera beyond description, and I rarely have to muck with the images before posting them to my blog (on the A410 I used to have to lighten or darken them frequently), as this camera takes terrific photos on nearly every shot.Highly recommended!
