I was worried that this camera would not have the quality of pictures that it does due to some reviews. I like the features and is really easy to use. The size is nice, and fits well in a pocket. I've taken super pictures with the macro setting. It is also nice when there is a bright light behind the object of focus. I have only taken it about a foot underwater so far, but has taken decent pictures in murky water. I am active outdoors, I scuba dive, snorkel, raft, snowboard etc. and I think this camera is ideal for me. It is a point and shoot and has limited capabilities, but I was not looking for a SLR camera.
