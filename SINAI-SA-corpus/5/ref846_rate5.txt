        Canon Powershot DS1100IS , July 20, 2008
        ByV  Nguyen (Fremont, CA)  - See all my reviews
This camera is one of the best price-performance ratio in the Canon Powershot line. It has more-than-sufficient 8 mega pixels and the image stablilizer and face recognition features and has a decent speed when capturing pictures. Even though you buy the camera based on the features and the price, the color of the body (mine is pink and the wife likes it since no one will want to borrow her camera again) makes it very unique and cute and makes it different among the common metallic gray color of the millions of cameras.  On the improvement side, it will be better if this camera has a larger screen size even if sacrificing the viewfinder then it is still more desirable.  The SD1100IS is highly recommmended.
