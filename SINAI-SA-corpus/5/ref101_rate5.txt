great point and shoot cam. comes with a lot of features that i dont even know how to use but it makes you want to learn an experiment with different settings. after you take a pic it takes about 1.7 secs until you can take another. controls are sooo easy and spread out. you can hook it str8 to your tv and see your pics before you uplead them to your pc. while the cam is connected to the tv you can take pics and it will preview them. very crisp images (3264x2448 res). bought it for my lil sis for christmas. she is 13 and found it very easy to use. like i said...point and shoot. buy it
