        Kodak CX7430 is a great quality camera for the price!, June 10, 2004
        By A Customer
I bought this camera and I love it! I checked out just about every camera in the 3 and 4 MP range and this one has the best quality picture and it is one of the easiest to use in the $200-$300 price range. I would recommend any Kodak for its ease of use, but I bought the 4MP (cx7430) so I could crop and enlarge my pictures without loosing photo quality. The 3MP (cx6330) was the other camera that I looked at in depth, but I found that the 8 x 10 pictures were blurry even without cropping.I would also recommend purchasing a 128MB card to store pictures. The internal memory only holds about 9 pictures on the best quality. I purchased the 256MB card, which holds about 190 pictures...way too many pictures, but it was cheaper than the 128MB card when I bought it. Six monthes later...I still love this camera! I have taken photos in every type of lighting imaginable. They all look great. The only thing I need to adjust with the Kodak EasyShare software is the red eye. There is a flash option to get rid of red eye, but I choose not to use it. (It takes longer in between when you press the button and when it actually takes the picture.)My pictures turn out better than my friends pictures, who oddly enough have 5MP cameras. The simple features on the CX7430 camera are great, you can't mess up. By the time one would adjust everything on those more high tech cameras, the moment is over. From the time you turn the CX7430 on, which only takes a couple seconds, you can take pictures that turn out great! The Kodak also takes pictures much faster than a lot of the more expensive cameras. This is something to look into when buying a camera. Another thing is the battery life. The battery life is very, very good for a digital camera. I have rechargeables and they last me a good 150-200 pictures with the screen on. Overall, great camera! I'm glad I bought it!
