The range of features is incredible for such a small camera.  Although I am not much of a photography buff I have enjoyed experimenting with different shutter speeds, apertures, lighting etc.  The AUTO setting takes very good pictures with quick recovery for the next shot.  Connection to a PC and printer is very easy.
