        Optional Purchase, April 4, 2008
        ByB. Johnson (Charlotte, NC)  - See all my reviews
This camera is really nice.  I like that you can add external lenses (sold seperately) to the camera.  If you are interested in this option, check out the bundle package from 49 St. Photo (sold through Amazon) that includes two lenses and lots of other goodies for only $100 more.  My favorite features of this camera include manual mode (or shutter or aperature priorty), auto rotates pictures, long battery life, great movie quality w/ sound, can turn off digital zoom, has an easy mode, face detection is cool, and you can add an external lens.  Cons to the camera include a little bit bulky, slow recharge time after each picture, and that's about it.  I never write reviews but I felt I needed to for this since I liked it so much.
