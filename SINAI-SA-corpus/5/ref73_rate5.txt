        ByD. C. Carl  - See all my reviews
Read many reviews before buying.  Always nervous with reviews - are they true/accurate/sincere, etc.  Bought this for my wife for Christmas, and she has used and is very satisfied.  We are not "high techy people", but it works well and is easy to use.  Will it last?  Who knows.  And once again we are highly satisfied shopping on Amazon.com.
