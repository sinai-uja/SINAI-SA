        Love this camera!, February 16, 2005
        ByK. SMITH (Central PA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this for myself for Christmas and after 3 months of playing with it, have decided its a keeper!  It takes great quality pictures, the software is easy to use, and the editing works great.  The red eye removal function works very good - much better than a camera I tried out last Christmas (and returned) Since we don't have a camcorder, we love the movies with sound.I do not use the share function, since I usually crop or enhance or something to make the pic "perfect".  I also do not print at home - way too expensive compared to printing at York, Sam's, or even Eckerds!One small complaint - the default in the Kodak software is to save pictures at a lower res after editing.  This makes no sense to me.  If you liked a picture well enough to edit it, why would you want to save it at a lower quality???  This is easy to change, but anytime you upgrade the software, defaults to this again, and you have to remember to change it.Second Con is the date imprint.  I chose this camera because I specifically wanted date imprint (without having to use software to add the date).  The date imprint is HUGE and yellow - very unsightly.I haven't had anything bigger than 4x6 printed, so I definitely want to try that soon to see the quality.
