I am a total caveman when it comes to things digital.  I have had digital cameras before but always felt reluctant to use them as they were too complicated, batteries ran out, the viewing screen was too small, and you had to wait a long time between shots.  Well, I am here to tell you to buy this machine.  It is great: simple to use; rechargable batteries, large viewing screen; very short wait between shots; AND it connects right up to the Kodak Easy Share printer (or you can remove the SD media and stick that into the printer) and makes exceptional quality photos.  For $200 you can't beat this camera.
