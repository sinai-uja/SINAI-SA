        Great Camera, Great Features, January 16, 2009

I used to be a Kodak fan.  Well, Canon has just stolen me away with this camera.  I bought this camera for work to use for taking product photos.  I really liked the manual focus feature, the white balance feature, and the large screen.  After getting the camera, I took it for a test drive.  Kudo's to whoever designed this brilliant machine.  Using the simpler features is intuitive.  The more complex features, while not intuitive, work smoothly once understood.  Using the manual mode in this camera is the easiest of any camera that I have used.  It includes a graph at the side of the screen to give more of an idea of how your picture will come out.  There is only one downside.  The viewfinder, should you want to use it, does not accurately portray what you are taking a picture of.  If you use it, you may find tha you will have to crop your pictures afterward to remove objects you didn't anticipate showing up in your photo.  But, then again, who would use the viewfinder when you have a razor sharp 2.5" LCD screen.  Overall, this is a great camera.  I'm going to buy one for my wife who wants an SLR eventually.
