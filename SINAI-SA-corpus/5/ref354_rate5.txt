This is one fantastic camera for the money.  Takes excellent pictures (added to the picture gallery).  I'm very amateur, but some of the pictures are beautiful.  The color is so exact and the clarity is absolutely fantastic.  Before I bought this camera, I checked out all the reviews and pictures, and that's what sold me.  Especially the close ups of flowers.  I've never gotten that before with any other camera, and now I am almost achieving that.  Thank you for the reviews and pictures.  That's what sold me.  As I mentioned this is the best price I've found.  Amazon has even beat Walmart's price by $30.  Love it!!!
