        Excellent camera, November 27, 2008
        ByWilson Moffitt (Waynesboro, PA)  - See all my reviews
This is my first digital camera and I am not sorry for the purchase.  There are SO many features that I'm still using the default selections except that I did select the highest quality for the photos and it takes EXCELLENT photos!I purchased a 4gb 133x card as the included 32mb would have only held about a dozen high quality images and there's no way it could have held the video's I've been taking.  The fact it only comes with a 32mb standard card is no by no means any fault of the camera so no points lost there as some other cameras don't come with a card at all I've discovered in my search.The fact that the camera came with extra goodies like the cables that some other brands try to sell you separately spoke good of Canon and it even came with good AA batteries, though I suspect I'll be replacing the next set with some Energizer Lithium AA's.And a hint to any other new users: leave the display screen protector on and don't worry about finger smudges or scratches.  :-)  They sell those things all over Amazon and other stores but the camera comes with one in place and I have to wonder how many people throw them away only to buy one again later.  :-)
