I am definitely an amateur, not as savvy a user as it sounds like a lot of the other reviewers are. But, from the other extreme of "photographer-smartness", this is a great little camera to use. It's easy, yet has a lot of functionality, which the user guide manages to clearly explain. I needed something very small, which it is, that takes awesome pictures, which it does. Battery life seems very good, so far. My husband likes the manly brown color, too.
