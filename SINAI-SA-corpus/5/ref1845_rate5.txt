Clearly everyone loves this camera.  I've been using mine now for a week. Everything people say is true: fast, maneuverable, excellent images, big fun factor for gadget freaks like me. I was waiting to upgrade to the next compelling Nikon DSLR because I still have my old FE; foolish loyalty. The specs of the Pentax K10D and the memories of my Grandfather's old screw mount Pentax convinced me to go for it. I can add this.... it would be cool if the extra memory storage slot in the grip was connected as addition capacity or add a compact flash slot. There's a lot of empty space inside the grip. What else can be fit in there? Wireless? Cosmetically the lens hood for 18-55 could have better lines into the lens but I am all for form fits function.
