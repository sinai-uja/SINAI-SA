        Get the A650 IS instead, May 8, 2008

I use both this and the A650 IS at my work.  Although this is a very good camera, it does not compare to the better capabilities of the newer A650.  Especially when it comes to the prices I'm seeing here (keep in mind that the A650 is going for under $300).  I mean it's laughable when you just know that the A630 is inevitably destined to show up on ebay someday for $10-20.
