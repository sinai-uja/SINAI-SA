        Overall a great camera, April 24, 2008

I bought the Cannon SD1100 IS about a month ago and I am happy with my purchase so far. I am not even going to pretend to be a camera aficionado but I am a casual photographer that enjoys simple, easy to use cameras that take great pictures. The SD1100 is everything that I was looking for in a compact digital camera. Compared to my previous digital camera (a Kodak CX7530), the Cannon is far superior. The images are crystal clear and the included software is much more intuitive and easy to use compared to Kodak's Easy Share software. The included IS feature is nice if you have shaky hands when trying to take pictures. I also invested in a second battery which has come in handy on vacation when it's not always easy to find time to charge a single battery. I only have a few minor complaints about the camera so far. First, the 32MB memory card included is a joke. No store even sells memory cards this small any more so investing in at least a 1GB card is a must. Secondly, the camera does have rather flimsy plastic doors for the battery/memory card and the AV outputs. The cover for the AV outputs is also a little awkward as it doesn't open fully. The only other thing I noticed about the camera was the LCD screen sometimes displays a solid vertical line or two when taking pictures at night. I noticed this when I was at a night baseball game so I don't know if there is a different setting that I should have used to negate some of the brightness of the stadium lights.
