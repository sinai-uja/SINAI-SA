        Satisfactory Digital Camera, February 18, 2009

This digital camera is inexpensive compared to other cameras and easy to use. I took a couple of shots with it and I noticed that you can't get too close to an object that you are shooting or it will not focus right. You must stand at a nice distance and use the zoom frequently. It takes some getting used to but once you get used to it, you can take some pretty good pictures. Another thing I noticed is that once you take a picture it comes out looking a bit fuzzy on the camera's display screen but once downloaded to the computer it's very clear and detailed. The camera is also small and lightweight so if you're looking for something that feels a bit heavier this camera is probably not for you. Other than that it's perfect for taking casual, fun pictures.
