        Nice little camera, December 6, 2008

I bought this camera for my wife who hasn't had a digital camera, would occasionally use a little black film camera for snapshots. All the kids (now college or past) have the predecessor for this model and love it. It's easy to use, intuitive, although it is unlikely she'll ever whoot video with it. She'll rely on me to download and Photoshop the results, but it'll be invaluable when she takes that cruise with her sister and mother this winter. It fits right in a pocket, and our son's underwater case will work for those snorkeling pictures.
