        A Dream Camera, January 11, 2009
        ByJ. Chu  - See all my reviews
I bought two cameras at first, this one and lumix, both at the same time so I could return the one I didn't want. I kept this one- no doubt the Lumix is the better build quality, but I felt like I was going to break it. This one isn't quite as good as the Lumix in image, but dam I dropped it like 3 times so far and the pictures are still pretty good. Great for when your in the shower with that special someone too wink,wink>.As for pricing, its a tad high when I bought it, seems to have dropped since, dam.
