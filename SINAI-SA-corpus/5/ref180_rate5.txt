        I'm very happy with my Powershot A590-IS, June 30, 2008

There's several incredibly detailed reviews that already break it down nicely so I'm not going to reinvent any wheels here. I'm just another person that bought one of these babies and am extremely happy with it.  It was a bargain for the size and quality and the pics are beautiful.
