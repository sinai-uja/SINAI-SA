        Fantastic!, July 16, 2008

I've had mine about 7 months now and have used it for family, outdoors and night sky pictures. Shake reduction works even with my old prime M series lenses. I have two autofocus D lenses (18-55 and 50-200) and use these most often, I like taking pictures with older manual focus lenses when I have the time. I'm still learning and appreciating more and more every time I use the camera. The battery life is much better than expected. For Pentax accessories, I have a second battery and the wired remote and I'm very satisfied with that so far. Pictures are great.
