        Over 300 pictures with it and I'm very pleased, May 9, 2008
        ByD. M. Kilbride (Minnesota)  - See all my reviews
I've had the camera for about 3 weeks. I'm very pleased. I own four other camera's and the 1030sw is fast becoming my favorite. The buttons make sense where they have them and the camera as a whole was definitely user friendly. Lot's of extra goodies in the software to manipulate settings. And I'm just as pleased with the closeups too.I will be taking it to work in my lunch box for the sole purpose of getting pictures of train derailments and if you view the photo gallery I put half a dozen pic's there that will speak for themselves. Yes the camera is spendy but if you want tough, and easy to pull out of a shirt pocket and use (quickly) this is it. 5 stars for this waterproof, crushproof, IRONMAN TANK OF A CAMERA!!
