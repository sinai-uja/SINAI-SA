        Good solid product, November 29, 2007
        Byjeffinvegas (Las Vegas, NV USA)  - See all my reviews
- backward-compatible with all K-mount lenses- sensor dust removal, image stabilization, sturdy well made.The learning curve takes a while but it's worth it.An excellent camera, I highly recommend it.Beach Camera was fast and as promised.
