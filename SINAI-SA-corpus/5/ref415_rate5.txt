        This is some camera!, June 18, 2007

I purchased the Canon A630 May 31, 2007 and to be truthful, I have not tried any of the great features this camera comes with, but as soon as I took this little guy out of the box and placed the batteries in, I loved it.  It is so simple to use!  I haven't even begun to look through the instruction booklets.  The memory card that comes with it is not all that good, but six pictures can be taken and deleted until you get the hang of it.  I tried the low light feature and there is some noise, but then I'm not an expert (Drip under pressure) so for my needs, it's going to just find.  I really recommend this camera to anyone.
