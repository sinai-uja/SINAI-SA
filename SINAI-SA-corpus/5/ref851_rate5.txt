I was very impressed with the quality of the photos and the camera itself. Just what I was looking for...a compact point and shoot with the features I needed. I did purchase an additional battery but have not yet needed it during normal photos sessions. I also purchased a 2 GB memory card which allows many photos and video before it fills. Bottom line... great 8 MP camera.
