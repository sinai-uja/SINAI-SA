        Great Camera, July 14, 2008

I own a Pentax 35mm SLR and I invested in some great lenses for that camera. I wanted to move to a digital SLR and salvage my investment in K mount lenses.I researched Pentax cameras that would give me this option, and chose the Pentax K200D.I have found that the K200D is everything I wanted in a digital SLR. I would recommend it to anyone entering the digital SLR world.
