I bought 2 of these cameras as gifts based on online reviews and price.  I couldn't be happier.  The first one was for my college-age son, (world's worst photographer!) and he used it straight out of the box and had a ball with it.  The second one was for my mother, (very technology-challenged senior) who was looking for a camera that would give better pix than her Kodak Easy Share.  The camera is compact, neat, stylish, and very easy to use!  Takes very nice pix, easy to transfer to computer or printer, and alot of fun and almost no stress to learn.  I got both recipients a SDHC 4GB memory card to go with their camera just to avoid the need to switch out the smaller card that comes with the camera.  Also, I love Cannon products, but I'm not a great fan of the software that comes with their cameras. I have Photoshop myself and find that much better than the disk included in these sets.
