        You Can Use More Than 2GB Memory Cards, August 7, 2008
        ByScott in LA (Los Angeles, USA)  - See all my reviews
I just received the camera, bought together with the 2GB XD memory card because someone said that 2GB was all the camera could support. Wrong. The version 1.1 camera firmware update, already installed on my camera when it arrived (no need to have it downloaded with the Olympus Master 2 software - although there is an update available for that as well), allows support of memory cards greater than 2GB. The camera comes with an adapter to convert microSDHC cards (8 GB for example) to the XD format needed for the camera.I was impressed with the ease of navigation through the camera settings using only one hand to hold and navigate at the same time.
