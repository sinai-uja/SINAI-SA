        Easy for the Beginner, January 19, 2009

Bought the Canon PowerShot A590 for my Mother who needs a camera that is easy to use.  This was perfect for her.  The Screen lists what mode you are in when the selecter dial at the top is rotated and there is an "easy Selection" on the dial that sets all of the parameters for you.  She was taking in-focus photos in minutes.  (She could never set the other older camera up to take in focus photos repeatably)  I have the powershot 560 at work and was amazed on how simple the functions were and decided this would be perfect for her but they changed models to the A590.  I would recommend buying a 4 pack of 2650mAh recharchable NiMH duracells for $10. (You will need a charger as well.)  And a larger capacity card.  I would recommend a 2Gig card that should only cost you around $8.
