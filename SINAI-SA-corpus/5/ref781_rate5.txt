        Amazing Value, January 12, 2009
        ByJillian French (Santa Cruz, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera in brown in June. I used it every single day for six months while traveling abroad, then once I got back to the U.S., it got stolen. Without hesitation, I bought the exact same camera because the price, quality, and features are unbeatable. Brown in a great color. It is unique (I have gotten many compliments on it!) and it appears to have a matte finish that is scratch resistant (though I'm sure the other colors do too). Brown is also a good choice because it frames the pictures on the digital screen well- the pictures truly pop out at you.One of my favorite features of this camera is the ability to zoom in on pictures already taken. There are so many great things about this camera. After six months, my camera was still working like new; it's just unfortunate that it got stolen. I recommend this camera to anybody who wants something easy to use, durable, and small!
