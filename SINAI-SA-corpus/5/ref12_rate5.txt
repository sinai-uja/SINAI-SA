        WOW - Exceptional for a point-and-shoot, June 15, 2008
        ByAnona Mouse  - See all my reviews
Most products I buy match my expectations. This is due to the fact that I usually only purchase what I have researched and am well aware of what I am getting, for the price. This camera, not only exceeded all expectations, but totally surpassed them. Knowing the quality of Canon, I was expecting good quality photos for a point-and-shoot camera. I wasn't expecting it to take photos that have matched, in quality, to much more expensive digital SLR's. The optical quality of the A590IS is as clean and sharp as anything on the market. It is very friendly and easy to use ( something I don't think most camera's are ).  Canon has blown me away and made me a believer in their cameras. This camera has left me with nothing to say, but WOW! If you are looking to purchase an inexpensive point-and-shoot camera, this is the one.
