This camera was recommended to me by daughter who loved her similar Olympus camera.  this camera has surpassed my expectations.  I was   very happy with my Canon digital camera but as we spend a lot on time in our boat and love snorkeling this water proof camera intriged us...we Love it. Wonderful clear pictures and very user friendly.
