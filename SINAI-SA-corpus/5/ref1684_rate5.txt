        Awesome Camera, December 28, 2008
        BySchuyler Svendsen  - See all my reviews
I admit I was a little weary about buying this camera with all the mixed reviews.  Most everyone seems to like it.  The individuals who gave bad ratings sound like they are just having operator problems.Works great in water.  Takes good photos, but you'll have to change some settings around to get it perfect.  Setting it to auto usually doesn't produce the best pictures.I've already taken this camera skiing, sailing, spelunking, kayaking, hiking, and to grandma's house to Christmas pictures.  Perfect!!
