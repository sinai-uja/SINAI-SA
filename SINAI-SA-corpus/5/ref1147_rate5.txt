        Great Camera!!!, January 19, 2005
        ByR.K. (N.Y\Israel)  - See all my reviews
I just got this camera and it is great!!!the pictures come out with so much detail and color!!!And the pictures upload to the computer so fast!!!The only things are is that it only has a little bit of memory, and you cant take more then 30 pics,so you should get a memory card,and also battery life isnt so long, but otherwise its great!!!I highly recomend it.
