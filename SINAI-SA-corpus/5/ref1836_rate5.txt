        Great Buy, December 8, 2007
        ByT. Herbert (Chicago, IL)  - See all my reviews
I chose this camera because we had a lot of old Pentax lenses that weren't being used, and found an adapter for them easily enough.  I read that this camera was very good, but didn't have a lot of lenses for it...Pentax also doesn't seem to spend on marketing like Canon or Nikon.I couldn't be happier with the choice, regardless of the being able to use the old lenses.  It has more technology and functions than other cameras in this price range, takes great pictures out of the box, and is built like a tank (it IS heavy, so be warned).  The weight doesn't really bother me, as all SLR's are bulky...you have to be somewhat serious about photography to progress to an SLR.It will be a long time before a "Prosumer" photographer will grow out of what this camera has to offer.
