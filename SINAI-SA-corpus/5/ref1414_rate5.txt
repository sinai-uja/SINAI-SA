The Kodak Z740 is a great camera for beginners and experts alike. It really is ready to use right out of the box. It's different modes are easy to figure out, even for the casual user. The Z740's high points are the GREAT zoom lens, it's ease of use, and the quality of pictures taken outdoors.The low points are no image stabilization and the lens cap that falls off much too easily.Still this is a great camera for the price and I am proud to own it.
