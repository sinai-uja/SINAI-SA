You can take it anywhere (beach, snow, underwater) and do not have to worry about it getting damaged.I have tried it 28 feet under water, went rafting, kayaking, canopy, and recorded videos while diving into the water and it still works.Good quality pics, up to 10 MP, lots of digital functions for you to play with in different environments.Flash is not that strong, but is does the work.You have to clean your camera every day after any extreme sport because dirt tends to get inside the water seals and in may lose its waterproof features. It's an easy clean up though.
