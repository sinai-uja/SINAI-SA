We have a Cannon Professional Series Digital Camera, but the lens and camera were big and bulky, and I did not take it with me to soccer and other events our son participates.  I wanted a small camera that took quality pictures to share with my family and friends. We could not have picked a better camera.  The photos are beautiful and easy to take with the screen on the back of the camera. And the photos are sharp and clear, and no delay when you take the photo.  We are estatic about our new purchase.
