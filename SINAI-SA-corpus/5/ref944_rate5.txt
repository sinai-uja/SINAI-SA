This camera is amazing!  It's economical, takes gorgeous photos even while moving in a car, has great zoom capability and macro ability, and the movie quality will knock your socks off.  Ignore those who nitpic in their evaluations.  Unless you're an 800 lb. gorilla who's hard on your toys, this camera is solid.  You don't need to worry about a thing.  This camera is literally a dream come true.  Order a 2GB memory card, and a couple extra Canon NB-4L Equivalent Digital Camera Battery @ [...] each and you are good to go.  I just returned from vacation with 503 photos that are incredible.  Just remember, rarely use flash indoors.  My indoor photos of the cavernous Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art are amazing with no flash, as are detailed photos of the art.  Some outdoor photos that didn't look like they would be good on the display turned out wonderful once I saw them on my pc.  I even took terrific photos of storm clouds at night.  This camera will make even a novice confident & adventurous.  I recommend Beach Cameras as the source provider.  The transition from my old PowerShot S230 was a cinch.  I met once with an experienced user who helped show me a few tricks.  Now that I've got those down I'll meet with her again to learn additional tricks.  It's all in the user manuel, I just prefer show & tell.  Once you have it, you won't leave home without it.
