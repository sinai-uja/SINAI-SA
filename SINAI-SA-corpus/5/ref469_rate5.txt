        Canon A630 hits a homerun!, January 11, 2007
        ByLarry Kanzer "the-locksmith" (Lords Valley, Pa.)  - See all my reviews
After considerable research, I chose to replace my Olympus D-520 with the Canon A 630.  The primary reason was to be able to take pictures of coins for E-Bay sale, and this camera fit the bill to the T.  True, it took some experimenting to figure out the right settings to do this, but once I had it figured out, the pictures were precise and detailed, and just what I was looking for.  This camera has so many settings and possibilities that I am now looking for opportunities to utilize it to its fullest potential.  If you are just looking for a point and shoot, just set it and forget it, and shoot away.  If you are a pro, this should answer all your needs.  I am a happy camper.......
