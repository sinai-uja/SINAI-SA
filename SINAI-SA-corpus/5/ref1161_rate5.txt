        A really good digital camera, April 22, 2006

I love this camera, however, the best time to take pictures is during the day with light. The night pictures are pretty dark, but you can still see them. The camera also only takes 2 AA batteries, which makes the camera pretty light. Overall this is a very good digital camera for the price.
