I have owned this camera for 6 months and find its picture quality superb. The ability to preprogram for certain functions such as cloudy lighting, movie mode, and a third incandescent light ( you can program many other features easily yourself) all easily accessible through the turn of a dial, are wonderful to have. Accessing the macro function is also readily accessible. I mad 700 pictures in the Galapagos islands, and having 5 mega pixels to crop and enlarge to make great 8X10 pictures that are really wonderful. The movie function with sound is much better than my Nikon 880. the 8X zoom functioned well. Comparing my photos with those of my fellow travelers, I think the colors are more saturated and clearer. Reading the instruction manual is important to use all the features of this camera. Battery life is shorter than I would like. Focusing when there is not much light and at times for close-ups is slow. Since I had read about this from others, I was prepared and accepted it. I have not tried manual focusing yet. Taking pictures of fast moving objects is possible, but difficult, as with most non-professional digital cameras. I enthusiastically recommend this camera.
