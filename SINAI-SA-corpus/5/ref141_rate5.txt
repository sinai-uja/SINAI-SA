        great little camera, September 6, 2008
        ByJ. Gentry  - See all my reviews
bought this as a second, smaller camera for my husband to drag along on his different outings and pix of his construction work. He is limited technically, so this is a great choice for him. It also has the macro for his close-ups, and a little zoom so he can compose better pix. I'm also promoting the new ENELOOP batteries for all things digital/battery powered. MAJOR difference in charge length.
