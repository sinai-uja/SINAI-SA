        Wonderful Camera, January 10, 2003

This is my first digital camera and I LOVE it!! It makes me seem like a professional photographer even though I'm just a snapshot taker. What surprised me most was the clear pictures and the resolution. On the basic setting I get large pictures that I can reduce on my computer and they look WONDERFUL.  Shooting in low light is a problem, but I have not taken the time to learn about F stops and all that can be configured. Almost everything can be configured on this. The 8 times zoom is something I just love. I almost bought an Olympus E-20, but am glad I got this one. It's a little smaller, which is very nice and it performs very well. I could have spent my money buying a ]$$$$] camera, but I'm glad I went all the way and got something I just love.
