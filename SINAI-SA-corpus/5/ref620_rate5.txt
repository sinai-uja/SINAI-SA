        A 630 Canon, March 31, 2007

I was hesitant at first about buying another Canon camera after not being very satisfied with the previous one.  I'm glad I gave Canon another chance and purchased a A630.  I would recommend it for the photography who enjoys taking pictures for their album and showing to friends and family.  Anything more elaborate the learning curve widens.  Even though I'm still learning all of the options it offers, so far I like it very much.  The pictures are very clear
