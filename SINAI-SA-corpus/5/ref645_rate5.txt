        this camera is our newest addition to the FAMILY!!, June 19, 2007
        ByVERY HAPPY "bang for my Buck!"  - See all my reviews
i have to say I LOVE my camera.  if you are looking for a fairly easy camera with all kinds of options that are easy to figure out (like at the aquarium or very bright lights...) this camera is for you.  I also got a set of rechargeable batteries and a 2G memory card (i have filled twice in two weeks)  the video is very nice..the speed is great for this price of cameras. the best i have seen.  i spent weeks comparing price, priorities(pixels, eye finder, batteries, etc.) and customer review...I am VERY pleased with my choice. things i LOVE that i was not looking for... the rotating screen (i like to throw it in my purse and it is protected)rechargeable batteries. My favorite setting is the "kids and pets" with the continuous picture thingy.(i am not a camera expert)...going down a pool slide or jumping of the diving board is GREAT!! all in focus!!LOVE IT!!!
