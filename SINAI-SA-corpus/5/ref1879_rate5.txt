        Excellent DSLR for the price., May 9, 2008

Built upon the fundamentals of the award winning K10D, you can't go wrong with the K200D.I've been researching to buy a first DSLR for over 8 months, and I realized you simply get the most bang for your buck with a Pentax system. K200D offers advanced features such as SR, weather seals, and dust reduction, but for an entry price. It offers excellent image quality and ergonomics. Furthermore, it uses readily available AA batteries, which makes it ideal for traveling.Although performance is lower in terms of AF and continuous shooting compared to the market leading Nikon and Canon models, it is not detrimental to what I will use this camera for. For anyone interested in landscaping and portraits, K200D is an ideal choice, especially with the vast amount of prime lenses and third party megazooms available.
