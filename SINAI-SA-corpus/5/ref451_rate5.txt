We bought this camera because it was the only one that worked with our Omano 3344 Microscope. Good Magnification (approx. 2x-10x), TTL Autofocus and 2.5 inch LCD screen with high definition makes the perfect camera for our needs. We take pictures of small electronic components: processors, transistors, capacitors, etc. Also regular pictures of boxes, labels and co-workers :) by the way, this camera has 'movie' feature that allows zoom when in action. Some cameras the zoom doesn't work in a movie mode.The definition of the pictures are great! So we are very happy with the camera.
