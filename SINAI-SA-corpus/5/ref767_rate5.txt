The Canon PowerShot SD1100IS is a great, easy to use camera.  It takes quality pictures and is very easy to operate.  Battery charging is a nice feature and seems to last a long time.  Downloading photos with the software was not as easy as my other Canon was though.  I'm hoping it was just the first time using the software that was a hassle and from now on it will work like my other Canon PowerShot does.
