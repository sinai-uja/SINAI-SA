        Great little point and shoot, December 16, 2008
        ByMerrick (NY)  - See all my reviews
Pros: Small, good detail, nice clear LCDCons: Typical Point and Shoot shutter slowness (to be expected)I own a dslr but wanted a smaller point and shoot I could keep in my coat pocket. This certainly fills the bill. It also has a neat feature where looking at the lcd in portrait or landscap orientation will automatically rotate the picture you are reviewing to match.
