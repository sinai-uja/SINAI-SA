LOVE this camera!  I'd never even held a digital camera in my hand before purchasing the 590IS in April '08 for a May Mediterranean cruise.  This wonderful piece of technology produced amazing shots, many postcard-perfect.  There are so many settings that I have yet to learn about but in the meantime, the "Auto" setting works just fine for me in any photo situation.  No disappointments there.  Great price, great product.
