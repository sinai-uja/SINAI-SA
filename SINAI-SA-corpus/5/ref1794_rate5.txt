        Not for the faint hearted, October 7, 2007
        ByDileep Kumar (Redmond, WA United States)  - See all my reviews
Pros:1. The camera feels rock solid in your hands. This is by far the best feel I've had with a camera. For me it is one of the important aspects since I will be holding it for long durations.2. Very good viewfinder. As somebody who wears glasses, a good view finder is very essential. This one has the second best Penta Prism view finder among its class (I've to give the 1st place to Nikon D80).3. All bells and whistles of an advanced pro camera. This is why I said the camera is not for the faint hearted newbies who is just getting into photography. The camera takes amazing pictures ... but only in the trained hands. Trust me, if you are into photography and to learn it the right way, this camera will force you to.... another reason why I bought this as opposed to Nikons and Canons.4. The kit lens is one of the best in the class. It feels very sturdy and takes amazing pictures. The 50-200mm Pentax DA lens can give you pretty sharp pictures if you focus manually.Cons:1. Default JPEG that comes out is not good. You need to tweak the settings to get the right composition.2. The software that comes with the camera is pretty much useless. Use other dedicated software like Lightroom, Photoshop or Capture One. I am using the new Capture One 4 Beta and loving it (still in Beta and has some frustrating bugs though)
