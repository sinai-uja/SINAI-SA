        Great photos, sleek design, December 31, 2007

I upgraded from my ancient olympus 2.1 MP to this one and I am very satisfied with the images, so far. The camera is sleek, lightweight and the battery is good enough for the weekend shooting. Default automatic settings work for me. I set the camera at the max ISO setting and the pictures came out grainy. Fiddeling with various setings didn't work for me. I am a novice, point and shoot camera user. Reverting to automatic settings worked great. I have not tried various modes (night time, snow, motion, etc.).The photos so far have remarkable resolution and color quality. I added a 2GB memory card and it provides for ~700 photos. That is more than what I need, however, I never have to worry about using up all hte space. I can shoot all I want.The joystick control is vastly superior to regular controls. The large LCD screen is a good aid and is helpful for picture reviews. The photo review is fast for a 10MP camera. Delete/undelete/forward/back all work at good speed. There is no viewfinder. Finding a snug camera case for this baby was painful. It is "just" bigger than the pocket size cases. The camera does not charge with the usb cable. The battery has to be in place (and charged) for uploading the photos. Having two cables (one for charging and other for uploading photos) is a bit of a pain. I would expect to do both jobs with one cable. Overall, an excellent camera under $200.
