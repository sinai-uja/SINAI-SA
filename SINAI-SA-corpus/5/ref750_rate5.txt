        I love my new toy!!!, April 12, 2008
        Bynmiddleton (Chicago, IL)  - See all my reviews
After much research, this little camera stood out. The images that come from this camera are remarkable. The colors are amazing and I've been playing around with all of the different settings. I took a picture of my dog barking under the pets and kids setting and the picture of him was so clear and sharp. Absolutely nothing was blurred in the shot and the detail in the photo was fantastic! I can't wait to take this on vacation with me. Now only if I can get my canon printer to live up to its standards!
