I just purchased this camera for my birthday, and let me tell you, I'm so happy with it.  the clarity with the pictures are great.  It's small enough to fit in my purse without any problems.  I love all the features, how I can change colors around.  I can't wait to take a trip and really test it out.  It is so worth the money you will pay for this camera!!
