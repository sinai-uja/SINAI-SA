Bought the Kodak z740 because I'm not a professional photographer who knows the ins and outs of a SLR.  Photography is somewhat of a hobby of mine, I enjoy touching up family pics with Adobe Photoshop.  So when I was looking to upgrade from my HP 850, I found the Kodak z740.  It has all the features anyone could wish for and they are easy to use.  But best of all it has a 10x optical zoom lens, plus 4x digital zoom.  It has presets for almost any photo situation such as, people indoors, people outdoors, landscape, landscape at night, portrait at night, beach (bright lighting), and more.  It's so easy to use, I played with it for days before opening the owners manual.  And the quality of the pictures is excellent, crisp, clean, and colorful.  If you want a digital camera packed with great features, a wide optical zoom capability, and 5 megapixels, all for well under $400, then the Kodak z740 can't be beat.
