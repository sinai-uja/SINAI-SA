I needed an easy to use camera that would take great pictures, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  This camera meets all of those requirements.  The pictures look great, it is easy to use, and the software that comes with this camera makes it very easy to transfer pictures between the camera and my computer.  The included software also makes it very easy to create online photo albums to share your pictures with friends and family.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for an affordable camera that takes great pictures.
