        Best Camera Ever, January 19, 2009
        ByAmazon Shopper (Stamford, CT)  - See all my reviews
I bought this as a replacement for the Canon SD1000, which I recently lost. As far as the features and user interface is concerned, it's practically the same camera. I'm glad, since I loved the 1000 and did not want much to change. Two great improvements are the image stabilization and the battery meter!!!Overall, this is a fabulous camera. It's easy to use, takes great pictures, is small, looks great - all the things you'd want in a camera. I highly recommend it to everyone!The color is not very baby blue (as it can sometimes appear on the computer screen). It's more of a metallic blue/grey. Very nice, even for guys!
