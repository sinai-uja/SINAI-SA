Pros:- Great Price for quality of the camera- Easy to use- Small size- Good battery lifeCons:- Need to remove battery to charge- No internal memoryPurchased this for a recent trip to Walt Disney World. Took over 500 pictures over the course of the vacation, the majority of which came out great. It was small enough to fit in a front jeans pocket, easy to use, with a great battery time, although you may want to look into getting a spare if you take lots of pictures. Mine lasted almost two full days on a single charge, which was good, but also that "almost" caused me to miss a few good photo ops since it was dead. After that I charged it every day. You'll need to get a memory card; I purchased a 8GB SD and it was more then enough room for a few thousand photos.I didn't think to bring the instruction booklet on my trip, but the camera was simple enough that I was able to figure out how to change all the functions I was interested in (flash, night type modes etc) within a minute or so. This is a great camera for someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, but still wants a good quality camera.
