I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas 2006.  We have taken over 300 photos with the camera in 2 months without a problem or flaw.  We have only shot in the Automatic mode, thus far, and automatic mode is where the camera will be set at 95% of the time.  The camera is great and the price is right.  The camera fits nicely in my hand and is a perfect size and shape.  I do not care for those "credit card" size digital cameras because they can easily be lost. The rotateable viewing screen is very inovative and useful when using a tripod and protects the screen when the screen is folded inward and not in use. The Software is very user friendly and I had no problem transferring the photos to my computer. I'd recommend this well designed digital camera to anyone.  I would even buy another one.
