so far so good i've dropped it, landed on it and forgot to charge the battery. panorama is just like it says 180 view. video underwater in a clear planter not too deep but with sound (i can hear the people in the room). i like it. power saver is made for me cause i forgot the charger on vaction and took video and pictures all week mountain biking and hanggliding. good wide angle pictures too. i wish they made it in yellow. snow boarding and diving next.
