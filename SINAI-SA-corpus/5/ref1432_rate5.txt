When I was shopping for a digital camera I was mostly looking at the Asian makes. I then read a report in Consumers Report that was very favorable to the Kodak camera. At the camera displays in the stores and office supplies I usually ended up talking to folks that already had a camera and were looking to upgrade. All those that had a Kodak were buying another Kodak ,while those who owned other makes were mostly looking at other makes then their present camera and some were looking at the Kodaks. My son told me about Amazon.com and the price was right and I ordered. I'm very pleased with the service from Amazon and extremely happy with the Z740 Kodak camera. It has more features then I wanted, but now that I have it I love having those features. I will continue buying Kodak products and will continue shopping at Amazon.com
