I had the Kodak Easyshare camera which I was pretty happy with but I noticed that my parent's older Canon Elph took better indooor pictures so when I needed to buy another camera, I ordered this one. I am still exploring its features but I mainly wanted a simple to use point and click digital camera that takes good pictures and this one fits the bill. I am pleased with it. The brown color is pretty and distinctive. It interfaced smoothly with my Mac and the pictures just loaded right into iPhoto. I did buy a larger memory card to go with it.
