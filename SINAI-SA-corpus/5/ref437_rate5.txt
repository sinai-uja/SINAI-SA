        ByB. White (virginia)  - See all my reviews
I was wondering which camera I wanted to receive for my birthday last September, and I decided on this camera because it was cheaper than most and 8mp.  I fell in love with it.  My only complaint is that there should be some type of Sport mode, because there were some very blurry shots.  I took almost all of my pictures on a moving band bus, it takes awhile to find the right mode to use... but I had a lot of memories and if I had my previous camera the pictures would have been very bad and almost every picture I have taken with this camera has been in high quality.  I love the fact that you can move the LCD screen around, all of my friends were amazed with it, and when you are in review you can rotate the picture.  I thought it is cool that you can buy an underwater case with it too.  Also, I highly recommend buying a 2GB+ memory card so you don't have to constantly change the memory card.  And rechargeable batteries, it takes 4AAs and over time you will probably pay more for batteries than the camera itself.  The Canon recharageables (not sure what they are called) lasted me an 8-hour bus ride from Virginia to New Jersey there and back, trust me, they are worth the money.I love photography and anyone looking for an almost professional camera at a fair price should look into buying this camera.
