I can't say enough good things about this camera.  I upgraded to this after owning a very low-end model that took abismal pictures, so I have something to compare it to.  The battery life on the 7430 is fantastic, I bought this around Christmas and after a lot of use just changed the batteries for the first time.  The pictures are crystal clear, very high quality.  The flash is very adequate and my indoor nighttime pics look great.  The delay of the shutter is very short, which is important to me with a toddler running around.  This was a big problem with my old camera and the 7430 is really fast.  The video feature is also great.  It isn't digital camcorder quality of course, but with my 256 card I got some great footage.This camera is also very easy to use and I highly recommend it to anyone.
