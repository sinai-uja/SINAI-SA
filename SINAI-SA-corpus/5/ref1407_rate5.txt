        ByJerry L. Campbell  - See all my reviews
After looking at entry level SLR cameras, I chose the Easyshare Z740.... and man am I glad I did!  This camera does everything it claims, and more!  So far I've just been taking nature, wildlife, and sports pictures.  They all turn out great.  I'm ordering a telephoto lens for mine today so I can get even closer to the wildlife in the ozarks!  Buy - You won't be dissapointed!  Oh, you can see my photos on Enairo.com soon!
