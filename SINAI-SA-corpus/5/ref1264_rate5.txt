I love this product.  For Christmas I purchased a 7 mega pixel camera that took bad quality pictures.  While I was looking through a Target add, I found this camera and decided to see it in person.  Upon my viewing, I fell in love with this camera, but no one had the color I wanted.  When I looked on Amazon.com I found this camera at a resonable price with the same quality.  I love it!  It takes amazing pictures.
