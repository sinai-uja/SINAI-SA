I've bought canon A630 in replacement for my A95 unfortunately lost during last December holydays (thanks God I didn't loose my pictures). Although I've not  have the  opportunity to explore all the possibilities of the camera, I think that people like me, who like to play manual, especially using shutter speed & aperture, will find an outstanding camera for an affordable price. In one word: Excellent!!
