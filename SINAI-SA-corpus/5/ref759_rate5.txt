my dad ordered me this camera in blue for my birthday..just got it in the mail today...and so far i love it! ive just been figuring out all the tools and whatnot and it is so good!! it has the option to make skin look tanner/paler and its very easy to use! i love it. such an upgrade from my kodak camera i got 2 years ago
