this camera is the best!!! it is so clear, it actually brings the person or what you want to takeout in the foreground while it casts everything else into the background.. it is really nice and i have it with a 4GB memeory card so i'm getting full use of its video recording ablities which are superb@@@ i love this cam!!! (tears run down cheeks)
