        ByMr. Ronald Li (Wood Dale, Illinois USA)  - See all my reviews
All I want is a compact digital camera that has excellent picture quality and very easy to use so I can take it to anywhere without much of effort and knowing I can take quality pictures. This is the one. Actually, this camera is much better than I expected.
