        Just bought this great camera, December 28, 2008

I recently bought the Canon PowerShot A590IS from Amazon at a great price ($109). So far, I am really enjoying it--it's my first digital camera and it is simple to use. Here are a few details about the camera that I didn't know before I bought it.Batteries: It does come with batteries. Two AA batteries were included, which only lasted two days (which I expected from regular batteries). I've since bought rechargeable batteries, based on other reviewers' advice.Memory card: A memory card is included, but it only has enough room for about twenty pictures. Just enough to test the camera out and take a few practice photos of my office. Good thing I ordered another memory card along with the camera.View finder: Not only does this camera have the standard digital camera "screen", it also has an old-fashioned (like from regular cameras) view finder. I like this because I can take a picture even if there is glare on the digital screen. Also I find it helpful to look through the small view finder when there is a lot of motion.Easy shot: The "easy" mode is really truly easy, and it produces really good pictures.Design: Aside from the price, I picked this camera after looking at it in a retail store because of the user friendly design. Unlike many other digital cameras, it is not a small thin square. It has a rounded side that makes it easy to grip and more substantial feeling. At the same time, it is very light and small and easy to carry in my purse or coat pocket.Overall ease of use: I found the camera to be simple to use and all of the included instructions to be useful and easy to follow.I really do love this camera so far and would highly recommend it.
