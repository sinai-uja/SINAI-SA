I bought this camera for my mom, who is typically technically challenged.  Not only does this camera take great pictures, it is simple and easy to use!  She loved it.  We bought the gold colored camera for her - it was very nice looking, not flashy at all.  We received the camera within a week of ordering.  Great camera, great price, easy transaction.
