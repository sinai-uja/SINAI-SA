I love this camera. My Olympus C-750 I still haven't figured out how to take pictures without half of them being blurry after more than two years. The Canon I figured out in hours and it takes great pictures. The menus are very intuitive and easy to navigate. The LCD is bigger and the body much smaller than the C-750. Only thing it doesn't have is the 10X zoom, only 3x. From off to taking a shot is less than two seconds with the Canon where the Olympus took forever to turn on and had a terrible shutter lag. The Canon was also less than half the price of the Olympus, a big plus.
