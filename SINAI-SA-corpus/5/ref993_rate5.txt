        great buy, January 6, 2009
        ByBenjamin Yurman-Glaser "i like music" (San Francisco, CA)  - See all my reviews
I was looking to buy a simple point and shoot camera to take pictures at parties and when traveling.  Couldn't be happier.  Great quality, light and easy to carry around.  It also has come pretty cool functions if you play with the instructions a little.  I would highly recommend.Note that a separate memory card needs to be purchased (they're ~$10 - not sure why it doesn't come with a nice one but alas)
