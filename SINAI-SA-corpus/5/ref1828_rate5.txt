I just upgraded to this camera after doing about a month's worth of research on different brands.  I had been using a Canon EOS 700 film SLR for years, but it was time to upgrade to a DSLR.  I am so glad I spent the time researching DSLR cameras, and didn't just make the "popular" choice.  I purchased the camera body along with the Pentax 18-250 f3.5-6.3 lens, which is a great general purpose lens for outdoor shots.  It will go from wide angle to long zoom.  If you buy this camera, you really need to get the FA 50mm f1.4 lens as well.  It is great for indoor shots because of the very large aperture capability.  You can take shots of your kids events without flash.Pentax SMCP-FA 50mm f/1.4 Lens
