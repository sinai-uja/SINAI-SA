        Very satisfied for the money! Very simple to use!, February 27, 2006

I actually bought two of these cameras in the last month.  My daughter is taking a beginning photography class and so we bought her one for her birthday.  I loved her camera so much that I bought one for my upcoming birthday.  It is a very simple camera to use with a lot of features for a reasonable price.  I did buy both of ours on ebay for the price of $250.00 and that included shipping.  Both were new and not refurbished.  I am obviously not a professional photographer, so I enjoy the simple instructions.  It includes several scene modes to make it very simple to get the best picture with very little knowledge but also has all the manual settings for those who know specifics of what they want.  The 10x optical zoom I found was also great for the money.  It may sound silly but another thing that I really like is you can use just plain batteries or regular Ni-MH rechargeable AA batteries that you can buy in any store instead of some fancy camera batteries as so many cameras call for.  I have just truly enjoyed this camera all the way around, as has my daughter.
