        Great Camera, not for everyone, August 13, 2003
        By A Customer
I recently purchased this camera.  It is incredible, more than I was hoping for in my first nice digital camera.  You MUST read the manual in order to be able to understand and use all of the features.  Once you figure it out, this is a very versitle camera.  I wont bother to list them in my review, read the Editorial Review for the details.Two cautions:  First, dont expect the super fast focus you might be used to in a 35mm SLR, this camera does take its time when focusing, especially when it is not in bright light.Second, the compact flash that comes with the camera is not useful for anything.  It will not hold more than 1-3 pictures when on the higher settings.  It will hold about 10 picutures on the lower settings. If you buy this camera, but a 256 or 512 Compact Flash card along with it or you will be disapointed.This is a great camera as long as you arent trying for fast action shots requiring a quick focus time.  I use this camera for 90% of the around the house photography of the kids and such.  I also have a 35mm SLR that I use for the action shots though.
