This camera is great.  I was going to buy the flip video, but realized this camera not only took High res photos, but also took 640x480 30fps video that looks amazing!  This camera is very Mac friendly too.  The only thing I'm not happy with is amazon lowered the price by about $25 3 days after I bought the camera.  Thanks buddies.
