Love this camera. Like all my canon's in the past. the pictures are crystal clear and it's small and light weight. So small that i can fit in my back pocket! User interface is easy to use! All in all an A+! The gold color is absolutely beautiful! A nice change from the boring silver color of most digital cameras.
