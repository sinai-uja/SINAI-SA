        Pentax K10D, December 15, 2006

Excellent overall. For an experienced SLR user, the Pentax is easy to learn. Setup and Use of features are well explained in the Manual. Becoming familiar with available features and programs will take practice.I recommend buying the Body ONLY and purchase an after market lens. The standard 18-55 Pentax lens DOES NOT do the camera justice.
