        Great camera for the price, December 2, 2008

I got this camera after having a poor experience with another brand (casio) small point and shoot camera. The Canon A590IS provides excellent quality photos and video both indoors and out. I used it for an entire week's vacation in a a variety of settings with an 8GB SDHC card with no problems. The image stabilization is a huge plus for this camera, because the small point and shoots without it often result in blurry pictures, even in good lighting. This canon is easy to grip and take a nice steady picture. The result is you can usually get a good shot even with the flash off in normal room lighting, because the stablization keeps the shot steady during a slower shutter speed.I used all the various automatic modes like indoor, kids, pets, landscape etc with good results, but auto and P mode seem to do the job in most situations. The video results are very good, even though they are only 20 fps, but this only effects fast action like a sports event, and even then is not really noticeable. I made a video of a flag football game that came out fine. I tested all the modes up to 8 megapixel. The 3M fine mode is my default for normal situations.The only downside of this camera is the battery life. For some reason, the camera shows the AA batteries are low even though they are only slightly discharged. As a result you have to often change the batteries, even though the batteries you take out still measure well into the green charged range on a battery tester. So do not throw away batteries after you take them out of this canon. They are still fine for any other device. Canon needs to fix this problem.Otherwise great camera at a great price for both photo and video. Get an 8GB SDHC card and a bunch of AA batteries and you will be good to go.
