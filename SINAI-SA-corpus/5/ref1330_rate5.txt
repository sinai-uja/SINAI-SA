        Great Photos - Even Better Video!, January 4, 2007
        ByGadget Nut!!!! (Alpharetta GA)  - See all my reviews
This is the only Camera you will ever need! I have had mine for 1.5 years and not only are the pictures great but I use a 2GB memory card for Video and the quality is amazing!!!  I can take a video, load unto my computer and have a DVD for the family to watch in less than an hour (if you can't wait just plug in the cord and hookup to your TV and watch the video straight from the camera).  I have retired my digital SONY handycam (which is a great video camera).I have used this camera extensively for the 1.5 years traveling to China, Europe and the US - no problems - Friends and Family are amazed at the quality of the pictures.
