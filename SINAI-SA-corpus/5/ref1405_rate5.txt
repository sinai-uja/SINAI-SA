        A NEW WORLD FOR ME !, September 12, 2005
        ByFlossy "Mary" (Down in Dixie Praying for Our Courageous Veterans Fighting for  the U.S.A. & ALL Affected by Hurricane Katrina !)  - See all my reviews
This has been an awesome experience !  I am still learning all the operations; but the manual explains everything wonderfully.  Purchased for multiple reasons:  grand-daughter, new pup, outside activities, still pics (eBay  but so far, so good.I also like the fact that I can upgrade memory, lenses, etc. when I am ready to do so!Looking forward to days with this "baby" !  It has opened up a whole new world for me !
