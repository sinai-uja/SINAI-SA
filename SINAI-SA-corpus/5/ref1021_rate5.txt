        Great Package, December 23, 2008

I bought this for my husband for his Christmas present. Don't think he'll like the fact that it's pink in color but for an extra 10 dollars for a photo printer he will just have to accept it. I've always been a strong supporter of canon cameras. We have had a canon ixus 40 for more than 4 years now and it still works fine. Just wanted an upgrade. Seems the new model is a little flimsier than the one we have. The switch for switching between viewing, camera and video mode is made of plastic and is recessed. I find this makes it a little difficult to switch modes quickly and more inconvenient. The battery cover is also made of plastic now and seems like it would snap off very easily if you were too rough with it. I have yet to test it fully but i don't think it'll be much of a disappointment. It came highly recommended from a guy who owns a camera shop. Plus canon cameras are the best in low light situations (for point-and-shoots). Great price with the photo printer bundle. Can't wait to use it.
