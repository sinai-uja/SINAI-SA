        Excellent buy!, November 11, 2007

I owned one of these before but it was stolen. I missed it so much, I bought another one.This camera takes excellent macro photos which is the main reason I bought it.I am very surprised that one can purchase a camera of this quality for a couple hundred bucks.It uses standard AA batteries and a standard SD card. It's very easy to use and takes great pictures. What else could you want? Buy it already!
