Bought if because of review I read elsewhere and I wasn't disappointed!  Easy to use, great pictures and video!  Nice to have the numerous settings for the flash and such but the normal mode is great for almost everything.  Surprised at the good quality of the video for a still camera too!  The only small complaint I have is the size of the LCD screen, but it is a slightly older model so what the heck!  I'm still used to taking pictures the old way by sighting through the eyepiece!
