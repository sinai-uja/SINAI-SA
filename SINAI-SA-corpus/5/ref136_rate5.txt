For me... it was between the 590is(8MP) and the "Sony Cybershot DSC-W170"(10MP) , But after test using the two brands, the 590is just dominated, with the quality, options, and price. Also you can't zoom in-and-out on the Sony while recording video, a key option for me. It's a great starter camera, very pro-like and easy to use. I bought the 590is, a Canon tripod, and 8 gigs of memory, and STILL! had $60 left over.
