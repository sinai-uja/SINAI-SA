I won't type a million words, all you have to know about this camera is, it the best camera I have tried. Takes an awesome picture, and it doesn't matter if its sunny or dark you can adjust for all. If you want the best you can't go wrong with this one. I paid 299.99 through Amazon.com and got 512MB card with it.
