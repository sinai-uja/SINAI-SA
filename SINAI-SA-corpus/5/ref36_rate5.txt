        Completely in LOVE with it, February 12, 2009

I bought the Canon PowerShot A590 IS camera in Nov. 2008 and I am very pleased with it. Yesterday I took 700+ photos on the AUTO setting outside in sunlight and dappled shade. Every single photo is crystal clear. My worst complaint is the user guide: "Zoom" is under "Digital Zoom" and "Timer" is under "Self Timer." Since these are its worst features, I give it five stars.
