        Excellent pocket camera to capture impromptu moments., December 30, 2008

Many of us past our "salad years" can't hang onto those ultra-thin pocket cameras. This one is small enough for pockets & not so skinny that I drop & fumble it, thereby chasing away the deer or distracting the kids and ruining the unguarded moment I wanted to capture.  Great picture quality, and a digital zoom that seems to actually work!  Very happy being spontaneous and impromptu with it.
