Hey Everyone.  My first review, but I am so very happy with this camera.  I bought it as a replacement for a Kodak DX7630 6.1MP I bought 4 years ago.  The price I got this camera for here of $109.99, is by far the least expensive I've seen.  It is only 1/3 the price of my old camera and by far superior.  Some points...1) Takes great shots, and with being able to adjust every setting, including focus, if auto or easy mode for some reason didn't get it, then you could.2)Movie modes.  Many to choose from.  The smallest is super for e-mail.  The largest although running better than a Meg a second is awesome, even at 20 FPS. I think it takes better movies, definitely in low light, then my digital camcorder.3) The only negative I could mention is that in the highest fine picture mode (which is not the default), the processing time between shots can be long.  Sometimes even 5-7 seconds. However, its default mode is superb.  I just figure finer is better, since I downsize pics and so want to start with the most picture info.  The time lag doesn't bother me.  If I needed rapid shots, I'd switch modes, or use burst.4) It uses 2 AA batteries.  I put rechargeables in it.  They have never run out on me.  However, I always recharge after every large usage occasion.5) I just got this at Christmas and haven't even gotten through the manual yet.  It does so much and I'm always discovering more.6) For example..my son had a concert.  I was way in the back.  From my seat, to him on the stage, only the stage lit, with full digital zoom going (16x), it captured a more then usable shot.  I was amazed!7) So bottom line...I love it!  Even if it was $150 it would have been worth it.
