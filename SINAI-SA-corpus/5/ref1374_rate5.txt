The 10x optical feature and 5.0 mp lens with a price tag of $299 , i think its a great buy . I have used this camera for about a month now and everything about it looks good. The 2 burst modes are really handy. The best thing about it - keep it on Auto mode and it takes care of the rest . The movie quality is ok and the length depends on the size of your SD card. I have mine with a 1 gig PNY sd card and i can record video for upto 80 minutes at a stretch. The accessories include a D-22 adapter ($10 value) which makes it compatible with Kodak printer dock series 6000. The batteries that come with it are not rechargable , so better invest in a good battery charger. I would suggest a Kodak travel kit with it as it has bag, charger and two Ni-MH battery. Overall a good buy for the price compared to the other didgicams with 10x optical zoom.
