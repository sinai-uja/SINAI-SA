This camera takes beautiful, clear pictures. Beats my cybershot by a mile for clarity and details. Easily worth the twice the price paid. I have not had battery life problems, and AA's are always available everywhere. Shopped online and got a couple of 4 GB HD-SC cards, (for less than $20) They should be good for thousands of highest quality shots, or hours of video. Feels good in the hand, light weight, and has good placement of the control buttons. I made a fun picture using the included photo stitching software, by sitting in a chair and taking 12 shots around the room, then stitching them together. Pan the image while viewing, and it looks really cool! Highly recommended, even for non technical users, great pictures automatically in 'easy mode'. Plenty of manual settings to play with too. Best sub $200 camera on the market, I got it for $105 shipped. :o)
