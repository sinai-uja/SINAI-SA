I bought this for my daughter in law....and she loves it. I too own a Canon SD "older" version....that was the reason we chose this Canon. Mine is still going strong after 3yrs of constant usage and takes super pics & video. This newer model does even more, cost MUCH less and now even comes in great colors! Way to go CANON!
