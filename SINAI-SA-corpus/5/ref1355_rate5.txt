        5 stars with a ?Camera works wonderful with one issue. , September 20, 2005

 The only issue I have and perhaps it's me the operator. But when shooting over water- not into the sun- I get whiteout in both viewing devices. Also the camear doesn't focus entirely, slightly blurred.  Can anyone help?
