I absolutely love this camera. I bought it after having an HP for about a year or so before it was stolen. This Canon replaced that, and I am kind of glad the HP was stolen. hehehe This Canon has amazing features, so if I want to do creative photography, I can... and if I want to do snapshot shooting, that is easy as well. I got this camera about 2-3 weeks ago, and I'm still getting used to all of the features, but I am not complaining. Also, I've used the camera almost everyday since then, and the factory batteries are just dying now. Not too shabby, eh? :-D
