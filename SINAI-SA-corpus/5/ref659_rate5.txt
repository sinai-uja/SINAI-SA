The Canon PowerShot A630 is a light, fast and dependable camera. My first Canon was the A75, 3.2 mp; this one shoots faster, saves battery power and has enough programs that allows a snapshot and a more elaborate, almost manual settings photo. It deals beautifully with difficult lighting and the photos are sharp with very nice colors. I'm an amateur and use for leisure photos. It is, as much as I looked at the other cameras, a wonderful value for the money spent. I'm happy with it
