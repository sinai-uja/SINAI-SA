I really LOVE this camera.  I have a very expensive Canon (pro type) since my hobby is scrap booking, and I needed a small camera for the purse.  The quality is really outstanding and the cost fair.  I was shocked when I developed my first photos and I was even more shocked when my son showed me all the things I can do with my new camera.  It's very fun to use and easy too!  I get so many compliments on the pink color.  Every time I let someone borrow it, they go and buy one for themselves.  That's how great it is.  I just bought another one for my son who will attend Berkeley in the fall.  He loves his too!
