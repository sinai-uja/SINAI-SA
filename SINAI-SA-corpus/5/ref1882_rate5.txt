This is an amazing camera. I began my search for a camera with the Nikon and Canon products. I had been a Canon S3 IS user for several years and wanted to stick with that brand. However, I was very unhappy to discover that neither Nikon or Canon offered products that ran from AA batteries. Carrying camera gear is issue enough without also having to carry all the extra stuff that goes with rechargeable batteries. When I searched for DSLR devices that ran from AA's, I discovered the Pentax. I am SO glad I made this purchase. Not only did I get AA as a power source, but the camera is FAR more solid feeling than any of the other DSLRs that I looked at. It is rugged, weatherproof (to some degree), and sports a feature set that lets you work in full automatic mode to full manual mode. You are likely to find, as I did, that the camera invites you to experiment with all the manual options to provides for some incredible levels of creativity. My photography has profoundly improved with this Pentax in my hands.
