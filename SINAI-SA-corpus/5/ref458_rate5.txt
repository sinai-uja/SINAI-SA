        Easy to use, May 13, 2007

I used to have a Canon Powershot A95 camera, which finally broke down after 2.5 years of use. It was an amazing long life, if one considers how many times it fell (I dropped it on) on hard surfaces. Canon A630 is a much more updated version of A95. It offers larger pictures (8MB instead of 5MB) and a larger display window. What I like about it (and what I liked about A95, too) is that it is light, easy to carry, easy to use and it offers good quality pictures.
