        I love this camera!, December 26, 2004

I simply love this camera.  It has everything I want. I especially like to play with the shutter speed and aperture in Manual mode.  This is when you can really get creative with your photos.  Although in auto mode, it does a super job.  I bought this camera for it's manual capabilities and the many accessories you can add to it.  I strongly recommend to only buy Nikon accessories.  They are pricier but you know you are not getting anything generic or substandard.  I also highly recommend taking the time to learn it and read the manual.  This way you will be able to use the camera to its full potential.  Many of other reviewer's "frustration"  come from the fact that they didn't take the time to learn the camera.  Also, if you take it to your nearest camera dealer, they will be more than happy to show you it's many awesome features.
