        ByDylan Gifford  - See all my reviews
This camera has a great feel. It has tons of features and most importantly, it's super easy to take great pictures. This camera is a great purchase in comparison to the big camera names. You'll get way more bang for your buck by purchasing this Pentax rather than some other camera. In short, there is no way anyone that pays the $500-$600 for this camera will be disappointed!!
