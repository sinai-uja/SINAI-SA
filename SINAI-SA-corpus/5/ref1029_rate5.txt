So happy to have finally found a camera with easy to understand instructions and picture perfect photos to boot!  Dd a lot of research and was not disappointed in the PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP. Light and compact, it's easy to carry everywhere you go. Just be sure to use the wrist cord because I did find the surface of the camera to be a bit sleek and almost dropped it a few times. Would recommend this camera in a heart beat!
