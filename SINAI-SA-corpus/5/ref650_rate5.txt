        The proof is in the photos!, November 15, 2007
        ByBrian Kerecz (Bethlehem, PA, USA)  - See all my reviews
Looking at the photographs resulting from the Canon Powershot A630, one would be hard-pressed to differentiate between them and pictures taken with a D-SLR because of the brilliant clarity, texture and color. I have uploaded six pictures to Amazon from a recent trip to the highlands of Peru in 2007.  The colors and textures come through amazingly well.  I kept the camera on Auto for the entire trip and practically every picture was frame-worthy.  Battery life is also quite good (much better than I had anticipated), and the 4AA's allow one to escape into the mountains without having to worry about recharging a proprietary battery or paying an arm and a leg for a backup lithium ion battery.  It should be noted that there are downsides to this camera; one being its size.  In this age of lilliputian pocket digital cameras, this one is quite honestly, portly.   A part of getting an amazing shot is simply having the camera on hand to take a photo; the size will preclude this possibility for many people.  Also, this camera does not take the best indoor flash photos, but because I rarely use it for that purpose, it never presented a problem for me.  But this being said, all in all, for the money this simply cannot be beat.  The A640 is identical to this except for its 10 Megapixels and the ability for remote capture.  And it should be noted that I use the LowPro D-Res 20 AW carrying case; the camera fits in perfectly, but does not allow for other things to be stored.This camera also does not have digital image stabilization, but for the price (I paid $197 in June '07), it should not be expected.All in all, a fantastic camera for the money.
