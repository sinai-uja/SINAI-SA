        Fantastic camera, June 11, 2007
        ByK. Fassman (Ridgefield, CT USA)  - See all my reviews
I previously owned a Nikon Coolpix 3.1 MP camera, so that had set my expectations before buying the Powershot A630.  This camera is a HUGE upgrade in many areas, including:* Fast startup* Image quality (which is an obvious one going from 3.1 to 8 megapixels)* Ability to shoot images in low light* The flip open/hide screen is great too.  By not using the screen (which is the normal condition when I shoot) it saves battery life.* The fact that it uses standard AA batteries instead of expensive camera batteries.* Even the included software to manage the downloads and view/edit images is an upgradeThe only negatives I can think of are:* Heavy in comparison to other cameras I've had/tested* Battery life isn't great.  That may have to do with my choice of batteries, too.* It should come with a case
