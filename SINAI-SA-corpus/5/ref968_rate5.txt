        I love Canons, January 8, 2009

I had a 4 MP Canon Digital Elph and bought this camera to replace it.  My old camera started giving out (almost 5 years old) on me so I decided to get this one based on all the positive reviews.  It is an excellent camera and takes very good pictures.  There will be some unclear ones, but nothing is perfect.  The interface is easy and it's very compace & lightweight.  It's very stylish and easy to use.  All in all, I am glad I stuck with Canon!
