        Great value, lousy SIM card, November 17, 2007

We love the camera.  It is a bit more complex than our old 2mg Olympus point & shoot, but all to the good.  Our only complaint is the SIM card only holds about 28 pics after we'd set it to 4x6 & medium pixels.  A bigger card is available.  GREAT VALUE on the camera, though.
