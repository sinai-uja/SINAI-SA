This camera is an amazing camera. Very customizable.  The ability to switch between RAW and JPEG with a single button push is a time saver. I have only one VERY minor gripe--that the buffer for continues shooting is limited to 4 frames when shooting at the 2.8 fps, regardless if you are shooting RAW or JPEG. The Image Quality is excellent, especially when shooting RAW. The camera is great for people just getting into SLR photography.  There are plenty of Auto picture modes to help you along until you are more comfortable taking advantage of the more in-depth control functions.Two important factors influencing my decision to purchase this camera over other brands is first: weather and dust sealing.  I live in the pacific northwest and spend a great deal of time outdoors so this is a must. You simply cannot get weather sealing in other brands of DSLRs until you spend around $1000+.  Second, This camera is compatible with all of my old manual focus lenses.  That means I don't need to spend MORE money replacing all of my old Pentax lenses, many of which have outstanding image quality. Just because a lens was made 20+ years ago doesn't mean it isn't any good. This is much more convenient and economical than other brands that change their lens mounts every five years or so. Because this camera has in-body shake reduction (something that Canon and Nikon DO NOT have)   ALL of my old Pentax lenses can take advantage of this feature. Couple all of this with wireless flash sync and the host of many other things this camera can do and it's an unbeatable bargain. I'm glad I purchased this camera.  I HIGHLY recommend it over any other brands.
