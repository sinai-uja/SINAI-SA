        Great Value!, January 20, 2009

This is a great camera for the casual photographer or as a walk-around camera.  It takes sharp photos, helped by image stabilization, and is easy to use.  An added benefit for the casual user is that it takes AA batteries, eliminating the problem of picking up the camera only to find the proprietary battery needs charging.  What really makes this camera stand out is the price.  Just a few years ago a camera of this quality would have cost three or four hundred dollars and now it's just over one hundred.
