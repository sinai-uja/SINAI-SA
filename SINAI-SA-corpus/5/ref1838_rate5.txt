Fantastic camera! Even just using it with the "green" mode, I have been able to take almost pro quality photos of my son's waterpolo games! All of my old Pentax lenses and flashes work flawlessly as well. (Hear that, Canon??) I do want to purchase a pancake lens made for this camera, however since I have a 70-300mm lens (that I had with my 35mm Pentax ZX-7) that works beautifully, I don't have to rush out and buy the newest zoom! I STRONGLY recommend 4 things to buy for this camera: 1) Magic Latern's Guide for the K10D--MUCH MUCH better than the instruction manual!! 2) The battery pack--GREAT item!! I NEVER have to carry my camera bag for an extra battery & memory card if I don't want to!! 3) The AC adapter--great for when you want to conduct a photo slide show on the TV for the family (which I did on Thanksgiving) 4) A LARGE memory, high speed memory card-you'll take TONS of photos with this baby! I have a 4GB and haven't completely filled it up, yet. However, I've been known to take over 90 photos at one waterpolo game! :)Overall I have fallen in love with photography after over again!!! Great job Pentax!!!
