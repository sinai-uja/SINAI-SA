        The new KING of DSLRs!, January 11, 2007
        ByRico Laguna "ricolaguna" (dumont, nj USA)  - See all my reviews
Thats right folks...I've owned em all...the Canon XT, Nikon D70 and D50, the    Sony, Canon S3 IS,  ect.    This camera has the ergonomics and features to appeal to the professional and prosumer photographer equally...plus it takes all the OLDER manual focus Pentax lenses as well!!The Shake Reduction feature is worth the price alone but the new shooting modes, the high dynamic range RAW files, the professional film look and feel give, and the great price push this camera over the edge and give it the advantage over all the competing DSLRs in it's range and even higher!....Welcome back Pentax!....what took yoa so long!?Now simply come out with a firmware upgrade/patch to fix some of the niggling issues such as the inferior Jpeg quality and the noise banding in high iso images
