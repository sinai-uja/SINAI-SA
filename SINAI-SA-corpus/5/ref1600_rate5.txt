This is a great product. Really clear photos underwater, quick-ready so you can grab it and snap a photo in seconds. Feature-packed. I really like the create calendar feature. The only changes I would make to the design? Add a viewfinder for use with action scenes and video; also it might be better to have the lens in the center of the camera instead of where fingers naturally get in the way. Battery life is very long, microphone is accurate for audio reproduction and this thing will take a beating. I used it for a month in Costa Rica in all sorts of weather, in hot springs and on the beach/salt water. Zero problems. A really great camera! Just what I expected from Olympus.
