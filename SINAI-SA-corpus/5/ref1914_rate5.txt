        Great pics, long battery life, August 30, 2008

I have had the camera about a month and am very happy with it.  It takes great quality pictures and has a great battery life.  I've had the originals in for about a month, and the battery light still says they're full.  The only thing I would suggest is to buy a tripod if you plan on using the night setting.  It does a great job with the lighting, but it's hard get a focused picture without resting it on something like a tripod or other surface.
