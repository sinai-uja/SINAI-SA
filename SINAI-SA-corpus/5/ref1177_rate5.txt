        Great camera, June 8, 2004
        By A Customer
I've had this camera for few months and have been extremely satisfied with it.  I took one of the best pictures I've ever taken using this camera.It appears that the maximum flash range is less than 12 feet, so you need to keep that in mind when using the flash.
