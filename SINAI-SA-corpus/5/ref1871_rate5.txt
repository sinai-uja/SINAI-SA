        Great first DSLR, May 27, 2008
        ByM. Cook  - See all my reviews
In looking for my first digital SLR I did not expect to go to Pentax.  With their larger product lines, Nikon and Canon seemed a logical choice.  However, like many people I have Pentax lenses and a Pentax flash unit from a 35mm SLR so I looked into my options to make use of them.While slightly more expensive than the Canon, I found the Pentax to be a much weightier and sturdier camera - not so plasticky.  The camera does not focus or shoot as quickly as the Canon, so action/sports photogs should look elsewhere.  However, for my portraits and landscapes the camera sets the pics up nicely, is able to view them well on its large LCD display, and is able to do minor edits before loading to my PC.The Pentax's 10.2 effective MPs means that the camera is very much up to par with its competition.  However it does not yet feature direct view that can be found on some competitor's models.  Also somewhat of a drawback is that the camera does not come with a rechargeable battery - it uses 4 AAs.  You can stretch your battery life by buying the optional battery grip, but I have found so far that the battery life is exceptional.  So far I have taken hundreds of pics without putting a dent in the battery performance.Pentax continues to produce good cameras for average users and I recommend the K200D.
