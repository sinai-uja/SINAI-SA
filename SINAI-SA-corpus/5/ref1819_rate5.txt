        A lovely camera, November 5, 2007

I have always used Pentax film cameras, ME Supers, MX, LX.  When looking into buying a DSLR (I had had some compacts beforehand) I was seriously considering an alternative brand until the K10D came out.  I was impressed with the reviews and so took the plunge.  I am very pleased I did.  The camera has a wide range of features the majority of which are aimed at photographers knowing what they want (rather than "modes" which hide what is happening). I especially like the ISO sensitivity program mode (I am nearly always after maximum quality).  The autobracket is very useful.  The build quality of the camera body is excellent and feels good and sturdy.  The autofocus works well.  I only have two minor gripes.  The first is the built in flash is very weak and usually under-exposes (I shall be buying an external flash) and the second is that the standard lens suffers from vignetting when used at its widest angle (F6.7, 250th sec).I would recommend this camera very highly.
