        ByK. Morris "Dynamic Ent." (Someware,TX)  - See all my reviews
Nice light but not too light. Camera uses sd flash cards and regular AA batteries. No hunting for oddball batteries like others!Anti-shake works slightly but not as good as hoped. Would still recommend trypod as with all other digital cameras. (Digital cameras still cannot duplicate a fast shutter speed due to the amount of light needed to make the image.)Overall this is the best digital I have come across. It offers the option of picture format choice of raw or jpg that others do not. It also has a wide varity of lenses that can be used to take many different kinds of pictures.
