        Great Camera, Buy Extra MEMORY CARD, September 14, 2008
        ByK. Starke "K. Starke"  - See all my reviews
I have no ocmplaints about this fun, little, sleek camera.  it has added joy and color to my life. The memory card with which it comes, however, only holds about 10 pictures.  You will need a bigger one and can get it as part of a cheap package.  I didn't see these type of packages on Amazon which sell the camera, a 4gb or 2gb memory card, and case together.  I would have purchased that.  I purchased a 4gb card separately which should hold about 1,000 pictures. Enjoy!
