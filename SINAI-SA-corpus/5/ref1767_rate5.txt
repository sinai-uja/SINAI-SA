        ByDana L. Benson "avid reader" (Texas)  - See all my reviews
I AM NOT A VERY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER BUT I WANTED A DIGITAL SLR THAT I COULD USE MY EXISTING SLR LENSES WITH AND THAT IS WHAT I GOT>  THIS CAMERA IS VERY EASY TO USE EVEN FOR SOMEONE WITH LITTLE EXPERIENCE>  AND MY OLD PENTAX LENSES WORK WELL ON THE CAMERA>  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO ANYONE WHO IS WANTING TO UPGRADE TO DIGITAL SLR AND THE SHAKEREDUCTION FEATURE IS AN ADDED BONUS>
