        Feels like a camera twice its price!, May 12, 2007

Camera performs exactly as it should ... image quality is simply stunning.  In photoshop, I kept zooming in and zooming in and zooming in, it seemed like it would never pixelate.  A couple reviews parroted one review that mentioned slightly soft jpegs ... hogwash.  They are fantastic. In-camera image adjustments are there, but I prefer post processing.  I have never used a better camera.
