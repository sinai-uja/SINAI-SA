I spent a few weeks researching different cameras, because the flash on my sony cybershot had error coded and stopped working.  After the cybershot I wanted a camera that had image stabilization.  Then I started seeing this new face detection technology, which I thought was very cool and I wanted it.  I found the A590IS because, I decided to go with a brand name that is well know with photography and it had everything I needed and more.  The shots are crystal clear, the ration of when you push the button to taking the picture is good, alot better than the cybershot, the face detection is cool also.  The motion detection technology is another cool feature, which will come in handy when my son starts crawling and walking/running. I thought I might have a problem with the AA batteries over a battery pack but it actually works out good with the new rechageable batteries that are a commone thing in stores nowadays.  I can't wait to start experimenting with some of the more advanced features, like adjusting the shutter speed. My only complaint is that since I'm used to the slimness of the cybershot the Canon A590is is a little more bulky than I would like, but I was willing to sacrifice size for quality.  Overall an excellent camera for the price.
