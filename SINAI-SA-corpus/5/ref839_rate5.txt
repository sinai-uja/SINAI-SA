        Excellent compact camera, March 25, 2008

This camera is an upgrade over my trusty SD300, which still works apart from the mode switch getting stuck once in a while. I took literally thousands of pictures with it, and I expect the same functionality and durability with the SD1100IS. This upgrade feels solid and carries over most of the features I enjoyed with the old one, adding image stabilization and--hallelujah--a battery life indicator. And 8 megapixels is enough for a hi-res 300ppi print at 8"x10". Best of all, it uses the same battery and SD cards as the old one, with the added capability of the SD HC cards. I have also owned a couple of Olympus (good) and a Panasonic (awful), and I can honestly say I'm a Canon man. The SD1100IS is a tremendous value, looks much nicer than the SD1000, and the blue casing is much prettier in person. Excellent quality photos. Highly recommended.
