I have really enjoyed this camera. It is really easy to use and takes exceptional pictures, and the printer dock is an added plus. I don't have to go to store to print off pictures, I can have them instantly, plus can share with my family members. The paper and cartridge is very good priced on Amazon, haven't found it cheaper any where else.
