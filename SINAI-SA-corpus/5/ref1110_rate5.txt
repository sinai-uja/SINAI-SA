        Great little pocket cam, January 21, 2009
        ByKate S. (Bellingham, WA)  - See all my reviews
I love this little camera.  Takes great shots (it's a Cannon after all), is very compact, great battery life, and even sports a viewfinder.  I bought this as a back-up to my DSLR (also a Cannon) and have no regrets.Believe me, I did a lot of research and even bought another camera which I had to return due to poor photo quality (the Panasonic FX01).  If you just need a nice little pocket camera, go for the SD1100.
