        TOTALLY AMAZING CAMERA, August 27, 2008
        ByNathan Holt (Knoxville, TN)  - See all my reviews
The Olympus Stylus 1030SW is the coolest camera I've ever seen!!! I just got back from the beach with my family and it worked great. We had a ball with it in the ocean and now have some great memories to boot!!! The picture quality couldn't be better (as long as you use good photography techniques, you cant fight physics). I took video of myself and family riding waves in the ocean and it looks amazing. This camera is a great product that I am recommending to all my friends and family. Also, as a creative arts director for a non-profit I will be recommending its purchase by all of our new recruits.-Make sure you buy a huge memory card though...I have the 2gig and it allows almost 2 hrs of video.-The floating wrist strap is a must if you intend to use the camera anywhere near moving water.Great Job Olympus!!!!
