        Great Camera!, July 22, 2008
        ByKeith (Ohio)  - See all my reviews
I really like this camera.  It is easy to use, takes great pictures, and has plenty of zoom.  I looked at so many cameras before purchasing this one.  This one had the best features and quality of all the cameras in this price range.  I was really impressed with the quality of the video it produced, as I didn't expect very much from a digital camera.I am glad I got a camera with a view finder as I have found on very sunny days at the ballfield, the LCD can be a little difficult to see details of what you are capturing.  The viewfinder, though, shows you enough of what you are shooting and comes in handy.The night scene mode really is a blessing as I have taken night shots with and without this mode, and it makes such a huge difference in night photography.  Speed is not an issue as well.  I took a picture of my son jumping into the pool and I caught him just as he was entering the water.  There was relatively no blur and it looks as if he is standing on top of the water!I also took pictures of him throwing a baseball and there was no blur in those photos as well.Again, this camera exceeded my expectations and I doubt that anyone would be disappointed in purchasing this camera.  Plus it's hard to go wrong with Canon's quality.
