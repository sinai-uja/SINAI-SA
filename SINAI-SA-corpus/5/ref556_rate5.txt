        great camera, January 11, 2007
        ByM. Potts (Niverville, NY USA)  - See all my reviews
First let me say I am not a big digital camera expert.  I know enough to take some great photos, but some of the technical terms go beyond my range of knowledge.  The camera I owned prior to purchasing the A630 was a Cannon Power Shot SD 500 (digital elph).  I loved the functions on it, but it was very light and after I broke the screen for the 2nd time... well, I decided it was time for a change.  The powershot A630 uses the AA batteries which #1 let me use rechargable batteries that I keep on hand yet in a pinch I can always buy new batteries, and #2 gives the camera extra weight.  I appreciate the heft of this camera.  I find I have fewer blurry pictures due to hand-shake.  the Elph was so light that I tended to move the camera as I took the picture.but here's the part that just flat out sold me on the A630.  the swivel screen.  as a family, we often take group shots of ourselves - using the timer feature.  As we set ourselves up for the photo, we can swing the screen around so we can frame ourselves as the camera is counting down.  (I also purchased a tiny flexible tripod which helps with the framing too).  When we're not taking pix, I just turn the screen around to help protect it!  knock on wood, I haven't broken it yet!At the highest quality setting, I can only get a few pictures on the memory card, but with 8 mega pixels, even the lower settings give great quality photos. I have not explored all options/functions/features on the camera, but overall, I love it.
