This camera is a great buy. I recently purchased it and I am very pleased. If you are an amateur or maybe you are really skillful this camera is great for most people. If you need very high specs and zoom and photography is your life then you probably need something more advanced. This camera is worth it and its only $130 dollars. I would recommend purchasing and extended warranty incase something happens. This camera is about $200 dollars in stores. This camera takes great pictures and videos and produces a crisp, clear, sharp, stunning image. I received this camera on time and so far I am very pleased.
