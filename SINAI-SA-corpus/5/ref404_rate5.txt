        Excellent camera, October 17, 2006
        ByS. Brooks (Los Angeles, CA)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this to replace the Canon A70 (another good camera) as I wanted more megapixels in order to take photos to be enlarged and have greater ability to crop.  The camera is easy to use, has lots of useful "one-button" features such as for night shots, aperture priority and shutter priority.  The camera can also be put in manual mode which permits manual settings and I've found to be very useful particularly for outdoor, backlit situations.  The clarity of the photos is very good.  The movie function is also very good and far better than the A70 which was more grainy and pixilated due to the lower resolution.The software provided is eay to use (at leat for Windows, I do not know about for Macs). A couple of features of these Canon cameras I've found very, very useful and you might want to consider in buying any camera, particularly if you travel.  First, it uses AA batteries which are easy to find, so you don;t have to worry about finding an outlet and adpator to recharge your proprietary battery.  Second, it uses an SD card which are also relatively easy to find and can be used in many devices, as opposed to say a Sony memory stick.
