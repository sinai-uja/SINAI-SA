        THE LAST OF THE VIEWFINDERS CAMERAS, February 17, 2009
        ByNicole LEGAULT "CHEFETTE" (POMPANO BEACH FL)  - See all my reviews
I NEEDED A NEW CAMERA AND I LET MYSELF BE TEMPTED BY THOSE CUTE LITTLE CAMERAS WITH NO VIEWFINDER. BIG MISTAKE. WITH THE SUN OFTEN BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU SHOOT YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ON THE SCREEN AND THUS CANNOT SET YOUR SHOT PROPERLY. I JUST HATED IT.  MY NEW CANON A590IS IS JUST AS CUTE BUT I SEE WHAT I'M SHOOTING, IT IS EASY TO USE, EASY TO DELETE SHOTS YOU DON'T WANT AND IT USES REGULAR BATTERIES.  PERFECT !   I LOVE IT, PERIOD.
