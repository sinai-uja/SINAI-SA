        Canon PowerShot A630  WOW!!, May 21, 2007
        ByDavid Brumbaugh (Albion, NY United States)  - See all my reviews
At the time when I purchased this camera, I had been working with an 8.1 digital camera that wasn't even a true brand name. This previous camera had been nice until it went and it wasn't even a year old. I had been using it for my photo class at college until a vital part died. Luckily, I saw the Canon PowerShot A630 and read over its vital statistics. It more than fit the bill and it was a lot less than the previous camera. I was able to finish up my project in about a week and a half and found timeto play with it and find out for myself what it can do. Now that I have graduated I have read certain parts of the manual and was blown away by what it is able to do. It had been the screen that had originally sold me on it and now that I have found out what else it is capable of I'll truly treasure this camera - I just wish Maria Sharapova came with it!!
