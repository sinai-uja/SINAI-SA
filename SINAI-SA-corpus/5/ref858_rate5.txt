        I can't believe what t his "little" camera can do, June 24, 2008

I wanted a pocket-sized camera that could be a constant companion and instantly available, compared to my Canon G3 which has to hang around my neck or be carried in a bag.  I spent hours comparing cameras and reviewing user comments, then bought the SD 1100IS and headed off for a two week vacation in Alaska.I am amazed what this little camera can do, often more easily than the G3. At the midnight baseball game without lights in Fairbanks on the longest day of the year I took hand-held telephoto shots filling the screen with the scoreboard, complicated field lighting, and then hand-held closeups of the face of my watch with sharp focus. It is my first experience with stabilizing feature and now would not want to do without it.
