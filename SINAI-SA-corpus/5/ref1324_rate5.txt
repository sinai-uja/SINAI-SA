I purchased this camera when it first became available, and used it until I updated to the z712. Although there is a two megapixel difference and the z712 has optical image stabilization, this camera is just as good if not better. The picture quality is phenominal! I passed this camera on to my sister, and not long after it ended up in a fish tank. We gave it a few days to dry and its as good as before. I always recommend Kodak to others, this camera is well worth the money! Fantastic!!
