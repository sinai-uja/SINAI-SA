Simple to use, clear pictures and great features.  The close-ups are especially impressive.  A quick flip through the manual explains all of the features.  It has all of the options you'd like to see in a camera for "regular people," and if you get the dock, it's easy to share and print pictures.  The "scene" settings make it easy to set up a shot no matter what the circumstances.  We previously used a Kodak Easy Share c330 and decided to upgrade.  It was a good choice.  The larger lens and 10x zoom really improves the pictures.  A great choice for a family camera at a good price.
