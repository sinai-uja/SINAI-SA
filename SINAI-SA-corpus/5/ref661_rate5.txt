        Very worthy camera, March 9, 2007
        ByVictoria Rakhshteyn (CT)  - See all my reviews
It is easy to use, not too big, neither too heavy. High quality of a picture, very high resolution makes possible to crop pictures as much as you wish. It is possible to make a good quality portrait from a regular photo. It is close to professional level of performance, but with very prudent price.
