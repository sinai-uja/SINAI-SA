        Very good value for the money, January 6, 2009

This is a lot of camera for a little price.  It is easy to use and has 2 double AA batteries.  This is great while traveling outside the US since you don't need a converter to keep it charged.  The batteries last quite awhile.  While not among the smallest of digital cameras it is still small enough to carry around and keep in a day bag. the 8mp give you nice sharp photos.  Because of the reasonable price I even take it kayaking...stored safely in a water tight box. No worries!
