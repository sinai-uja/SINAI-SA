I am definitely satisfied with my A630 digital camera.  The quality of the camera and the features it contains far outweigh the cost of the camera.  One of the coolest features is the fold-out LCD screen that helps protect the screen from scratches and also allows you to have a clear view of the screen when the camera is at any angle, including when it is pointed at yourself.
