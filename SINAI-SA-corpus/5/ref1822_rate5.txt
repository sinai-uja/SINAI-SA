I have had this camera for over one year and each day learn more about the power of this camera.  Recently took photo course and many in class had high powered Nikons and Canon DSLR's.  My camera kept right up and in many cases had features their cameras did not, such as built in image stablization, and raw button.   Just saw new DXO website that ranks K10D above many DSLR's and higher than some more expensive DSLR's.  This is a great camera but not for the novice.
