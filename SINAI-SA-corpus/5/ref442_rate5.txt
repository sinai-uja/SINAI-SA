I am very pleased with the camera. I really like the adjustable flip out display.When people are in front of me, I can turn the display down and hold the camera over everyones head and still see what I'm trying to photograph. Excellent Camera. I received it within the quoted delivery time.I also could not find it at a lower price then at Amazon.
