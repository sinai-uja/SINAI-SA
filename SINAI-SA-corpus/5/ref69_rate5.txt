        Viewfinder = Best Selling Point  Shoot, January 19, 2009
        Bybeck  - See all my reviews
This camera has some "issues" that are annoyingas do all point and shoot cameras in the $100 to $150 range.The one thing that sets this camera apart fromall (or most) other compacts is the VIEWFINDER. Too hard to shoot outdoors with an LCD that you can hardly see in the sunlight. What do I expect for $100.00 ??? A viewfinder so I can shoot outside. The 590IS isthe only compact I've found that has one.
