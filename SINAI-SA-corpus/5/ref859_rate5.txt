First off, let me say that I am the worse photographer. I am terrible with a camera. However, I needed something during my travels in Europe and, after careful review of the other point-and-click cameras, decided to go with this one. I am very happy with it! There are lots of cool features about this camera, like the video recording and digital image switch to micro photos (for flora shots). The color of the images are close to accurate and the camera does help in stabilizing pictures that are awkward to take, like the ceilings of a cathedral. It's very light weight and compact, which were two features that were important to me. All in all, a good little camera. I would recommend this item to a friend.
