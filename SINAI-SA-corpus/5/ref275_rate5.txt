I bought this camera for my wife who hates complexity. Particularly where cameras are involved. She wants a picture? All she wants to be required to do is point it and push the button. The Canon PowerShot A590IS is the "no brainer" I have been looking for, and the one my wife needs. I couldn't be happier as for more involved photo taking, the camera has all the bells and whistles to do just that and easily too. Crikey!, it even shoots movies! Who could ask for more. And, at such a remarkable price.
