        ByBertha Kamarainen (West Monroe, LA USA)  - See all my reviews
I find this camera to be just what I was looking for. It is very easy to use and the connection to my PC for downloading photos is super too in that I like not having to remove the card and insert it into my PC (the less handling of those cards the better!). The price I found here was far better than any other web site or local retailers, so without a doubt, I'm totally happy and recommend this camera without reservation.
