        A superb camara, July 28, 2005
        ByM. Neil (Pa 19343, USA)  - See all my reviews
My camera arrived 1 day before my holiday in Europe so I did not have time to read the manual but when I returned I had 157 pics in the camera (it did not get charged in the 2 weeks) and the quality is superb.  I have never been so impressed with a camera before and I am totally delighted with my purchase.  Very easy to use, I did not utilize all the functions but those I used were pretty intuitive.  I would recommend to anyone.  Also got the dock which I did not take on holiday but did print a couple out when I got back.  As there were so many I took the memory card down to the local Kodak center and printed them off and that worked very well.  One small hitch, camera arrived with wrong cable for connection to computer, I did not realize until I got back and tried to download, but Kodak help center was very helpful and are sending me a new cable.  For these pics I got a CD so I could load onto computer and email to friends.
