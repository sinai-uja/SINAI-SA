We got this for our 7 year old son for Christmas. We had other, cheaper, digital cameras for him before and he was never satisfied with the pictures he was getting. He could tell the difference between his pictures and the ones taken on our SLR (Cannon Rebel XT). This camera is user-friendly, as we have come to appreciate from Cannon. The pictures and options are great for the size and price. I have been waiting for a camera that is comparable to our SLR that isn't as large and with a price tag I could justify. This is pretty close to that camera and I have enjoyed when my son lets me use his.
