Probably the best bang for buck you can get with a DSLR. Just remember to set the jpeg output to "bright". Either that or use RAW. For some reason mine came with a piece of lint on the sensor, but I blew it out with some air. Be sure to get a good cleaning kit. I recommend one of the Eclipse kits. You can even get some from other sites that comes with a foot pump (air pump that comes with inflatable mattresses). Sometimes those little hand blowers don't put out enough air and compressed air cans can be corrosive. Also check out the Tamron 18-250mm lens. There are good thoughts/reviews about it at dpreview and photozone. One thing I recommend that you do also is check the website that sells the camera such as adorama etc. When I ordered from amazon they charged me more shipping than the standard price (based it off the order total rather than just the part coming from beach camera) and additionally I saw that the store it was coming from had free shipping that week. They had also discounted the camera $10. So I ended up paying $30 more to get it from the same place through amazon.
