        ByDon "Don" (Pittsburgh, PA USA)  - See all my reviews
I have a rather expensive Nikon camera, but needed a point and shoot for the rest of the family. The family is very pleased with the camera thus far although it is a little early to praise it too much. I can say with confidence that based upon the family's delight with the small camera size and excellent pictures that they have taken, I purchased another SD1100 IS (camera only) for myself so that I can carry the camera with me in my shirt pocket. We have not used the printer yet although I purchased the camera and printer since it was a package deal (and pink?????) at a very attractive price (on sale before Christmas). The family wanted the camera & printer set so that they could easily print selected pictures. Sorry that I cannot give you a personal review of the printer but reviews on the Internet are very positive for image quality although at the price of a large footprint.
