        Great camera, May 9, 2008

I saw this camera at a dive show.  The Olympus rep placed the camera flat and then hit the LCD with a closed fist.  I've broken many a point N shoot, so after seeing that, I figured this one would last a bit longer.  I just returned from Little Cayman.  The camera was dropped, it still worked; submerged in salt water, still worked; submerged in a pitcher of beer, still worked; and subjected to normal stresses found on a bouncing boat and it still works!  The battery lasted for several days prior to needing a recharge.  The UW pics turned out ok.  Most required some color correction but nothing horrible.  I'd like if the camera would record in RAW.  For snorkeling, this would be great or shallow dives.
