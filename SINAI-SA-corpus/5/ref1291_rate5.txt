        Great camera at a great price, August 17, 2005
        ByJ. Willis (Binghamton, NY)  - See all my reviews
I took time to review many different models. I and my family are average users, looking for the best price versus features versus ease of use. After reading the rave reviews of the Z740 I decided to purchase it. Amazon had the best price hands down--about $30 less than anyone else. There was no sales tax required with Amazon, and it was delivered inside of 4 days (free shipping).We have not been disappointed! This camera is very easy to use, and it takes amazing pictures. With 10X optical zoom and 5 megapixels, the clarity and color are superb. TIP#1: Forget digital zoom when you evaluate cameras--digital zoom makes little dots bigger and is fairly useless because the pictures become less crisp when using digital zoom. You want as much optical zoom as you can get. TIP#2: Get extra storage for your pictures. I purchased a 1 GB SD card at Staples (about $65 after rebates and discounts) and can easily store at least 400 high quality pictures.As a bonus I decided to subscribe to the Kodak Gallery ([...]) to share the pictures we take--a great service and easy to use.This is a great camera, and Amazon is a great company. A very satisfying online purchase.
