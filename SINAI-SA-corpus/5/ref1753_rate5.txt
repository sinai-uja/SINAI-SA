After researching for a long time I decided to enter the dSLR world through the Pentax K10D. And it is really an amazing camera. The feature set rivals those cameras on the mid-market level but with an entry level price tag. Also the compatibility with all lenses made for Pentax is a huge plus, and all of them enjoying the image stabilization thanks to the in-body shake reduction system. I'm very pleased with the gear and becoming a Pentax fan.
