I am a Marine in Iraq, this camera has stood up to the dust storms, sweat, wind, and a pounding from it's owner.  This camera is extremely tough and rugged, and the battery life is good.  A great buy for anyone who wants a camera that can stand up to anything.  I only wish it used SD like everyone else.
