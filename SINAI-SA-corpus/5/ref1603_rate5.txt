This is an excellent camera.  My husband bought it for me for our trip to Hawaii after my Pentax waterproof camera broke.  It takes great terrestrial photos as well as underwater photos.  The battery lasts fairly well, and the charger is small and compact.  It has many options of different modes, including a few different choices for underwater modes -which is great. It was a convenient size to make it easy to take anywhere.  I also use Nikon D300 and this is great for when you just want to take snapshots and don't want to take along a big camera.
