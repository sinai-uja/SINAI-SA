        Amazing bang for the buck, February 2, 2009
        Bypegwatcher "Jim" (Seattle, WA USA)  - See all my reviews
Besides being a great point and shoot camera, the A590IS allows manual control for difficult situations or creative photography.I wanted a camera that could be used for digitizing my old prints and 35mm transparencies. I fully expected to pay hundreds more for the features I needed and am amazed that a camera with this functionality can be bought for slightly over a hundred dollars.It enables manual control of aperature, shutter speed and focus in addition to macro mode for focusing down to 2 inches. Macro mode in combination with optical zoom allows focusing down to 12 inches and a reduction of barrel distortion.There are so many features and shooting modes a brief review cannot begin to cover them. I suggest a potential buyer do as I did and examine the 200 page user guide available in .pdf format on the Canon website.
