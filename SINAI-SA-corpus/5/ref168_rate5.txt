        Best all around point and shoot bar none, January 20, 2009
        BySam H. Kocherov "Digital Photography Instructor" (Cincinnati, OH)  - See all my reviews
This camera has everything anyone would want to acquire top notch digital photography. I am a retired professional commercial photographer who has always been an advocate for Canon brand cameras. I bought one (at a higher price) for my granddaughter, decided it was a super buy, and bought one for myself from Amazon.This camera is actually an equal quality wise to the DSLR Canon I have except for the lack of additional interchangeable lenses, which are not an expected advantage for point and shoot cameras. The range of available features cannot be equaled anywhere near this fantastic price.
