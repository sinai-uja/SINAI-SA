        A590IS Canon, January 30, 2009
        ByJohn Toeppen (SF Bay area)  - See all my reviews
I own two of these A590IS cameras and three A570ISs.  I shoot 3D images by using two of these at a time.  The A590IS has an optically stabliized image that is very useful in low light or when the camera is zoomed in at 4X.  The display is sufficient to preview the composition in full sunlight, but the optical viewfinder is also a fine feature to have.Rechargable AA battereis last about 200 shots or more and the display may be turned off to increase this.  However the display does not seem to draw so much power that this is worth doing.  The AA battereis make this camera larger than some other Canons, but I prefer the AAs due to their general availabity when on vacation.  One set of lithium batteries may be used to fill an 8gig card without replacement.The graphite fiber plastic body is more robust than the metal body used in the A570ISs that I also have that tends to show dents from heavy use.The only feature that could be improved upon with this camera is the focal length of the zoom lens.  I would also recommed the SX110 that I purchased for its 10x zoom lens.The video fuction of this camera is also great, and better than video cameras in that it isa full 640x480 at 30 frames per second.  Normal video cameras are not as good for viewing on the computer due to "interlacing" that prevents fozen images from being sharp.The Canon A590IS is a very good value.
