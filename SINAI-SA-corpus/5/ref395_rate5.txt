I really like the way the screen orients to the direction you took the shot.  This camera is easy to use and takes beautiful pictures.  It's amazing how much cameras have improved and prices have fallen.  Hurrah for the march of technology.  Now everyone can take nice snapshots of friends, family and vacations.
