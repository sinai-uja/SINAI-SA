        great camera for the price, September 28, 2008
        ByJoydeep Sen Sarma (Sunnyvale, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
i have had this camera for a few months now. i think its fantastic for the price. the image stabilization works well - i regularly shoot at 1/15. the camera feels very substantial - much more so than the equivalent canon and nikon pieces. the kit lens is very good. the flash is very powerful. i loved shooting RAW for the first time and am totally taken away by its potential - i am never going to shoot with a camera without RAW again! i have had no issues with color and such - although i have heard professional reviews that have complained about it.some problems that i saw - the fps rate is really low and seems lower than the specified 2.8. Shooting 3 shots in auto-bracket mode seems to take forever. the software for converting RAW is not that great. i had also bought a remote control from some asian site - and didn't have much success using it - although that likely the remote's fault and not the camera. and i am not a great fan of having to go through multiple clicks to do simple things like changing ISO speed. Canon controls are superior in this respect.
