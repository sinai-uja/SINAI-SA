i used this camera on 4 european trips and came back with over 300 pics each time without ever needing to change batteries. Person after person marvels at the fantastic shots i took. several have been blown up to 8x10, 5x7 and framed. this is a fantastic unit that meets all my needs. i am not a professional user, but a damn good everyday photo taker. you won't be disapponted with this model. love the dock charger feature also.
