My first digital camera.  At first I was a little overwelmed with all the buttons but after a few hours of reading it finally made sense.  Most of that was my denseness.  I am more than happy with quality of pictures.  Still learning but that is all part of the game. Have shot in very low light and pictures come out with great definition and color.  Thank-you Nikon. 1st rate camera.
