I just completed a scenic trip and brought this Canon A590is along.  I also carry a Canon DSLR (XSi).  The A590is does a great job of capturing photos in a variety of situations.  Easy to use and offers great flexibility with easy access to the various modes.  The screen is clear and bright.  Uses 2 AA batteries, I got over 350 shots on a pair of rechargeables.Get a 4GB or 8GB SDHC card and a screen protector.SECURE DIGITAL 8GB SDHC CLASS 6 CARD (SD68GB)BEST--Premium Ultra Clear Reusable 3.0" / 3.0-Inch Digital Camera LCD Screen Protector with Lint Cleaning Cloth for CANON EOS REBEL XSI, 40D, POWERSHOT G9 SD750, SD790, SD870, KODAK EASYSHARE M1033, M883, NIKON L18, S51, S51c, S52, S52C, D300, OLYPUS FE-350, ...orGOOD--Universal Digital Camera LCD Screen Protectors for All Screen sizes up to 3.50" X 4.25"
