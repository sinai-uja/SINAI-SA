I bought this camera for my daughter's 7th birthday. By the end of the day she had taken about 200 pictures! She can use it easily and fluently. The ONLY downfall is the lack of memory. Don't buy th camera without expecting to buy a memory card also... Though I think this is standard with most cameras anyway. For such a small camera this is an awesome product. GREAT purchase! No regrets!
