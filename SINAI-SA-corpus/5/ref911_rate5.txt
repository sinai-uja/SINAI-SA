What more can I say that others haven't said about this lovely piece of electronic. It captured my wedding anniversary so well(Video) and the pictures looked so professional. I love that the pink is much more brilliant than pictured here and everyone I know asks me where I got it from. I've always loved Cannon but this is my finnest camera to date.
