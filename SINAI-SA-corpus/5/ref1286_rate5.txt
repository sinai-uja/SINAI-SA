        This camera does so much!!, October 31, 2005
        BySara-s (New York)  - See all my reviews
I bought the Kodak z740 primarily for the high resolution and the 10x zoom, both of which are worth every penny.  Once I got the camera, I discovered that it has far more to offer.  It is surprisingly compact and lightweight.  I found it easy to learn and operate, plus it has all the different shooting modes.Here's what I love about it:1)You can figure out how to use it with very little trouble. (But read the manual, to get some helpful tips.)2)All the different shooting modes allow you to get shots you might otherwise miss.3)The burst mode, for action shots is awesome.  I was able to get sharply focused shots of ducks flapping their wings.4)The camera has good ergonomic design; the grip is comfortable and the buttons can be worked with ease.5)It is designed to accept accessories, such as filters and a wide angle lens.A couple of hints:1)The flash pops up automatically when the camera is turned on.  This is normal.  If it bothers you, just hold your finger over it, when you power up.2)The wide angle lens gets in the way of the flash, so wide-angle shots may come out too dark.  If you switch the camera to night mode, it should solve this problem.3)Kodak sells accessories for the camera, but they are pricey.  Look on line for other companies that sell compatible accessories for less.4)It's a great camera. Have fun with it!!!
