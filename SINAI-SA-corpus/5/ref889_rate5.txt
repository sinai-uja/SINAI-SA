I bought this Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with great expectations and was not disappointed. I have a higher end Canon but needed a simpler one for my wife and daughter. I bought two of these at slightly different times and in two different colors so they wouldn't get mixed up. They are getting great baby pics of my daughter's new baby boy. The camera is easy to carry in almost any pocket, easy to learn to use in basic modes, and takes great pictures. Very Nice Product!
