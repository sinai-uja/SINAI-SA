        Easy to use- great for the price, January 21, 2009

I'm a late convert to the digital age over film, but this camera makes me wonder why I waited. It takes phenomenal photos, and is easy to use. 999 photos (with a larger media card than provided). How much would that equivalent in film cost? And then add in the cost of developing, and you've already paid for this camera. I have a media card device so I just pop the media card out of the camera and download directly. SO cool! Then import the photos into any type of photo-shopping program, crop it (if need be) and print. Your PC is your darkroom! In 8 mega-pixel glory, no less. And you cannot beat the price. I highly recommend this camera to the novice and the pro who wants a lightweight camera to carry around with them.
