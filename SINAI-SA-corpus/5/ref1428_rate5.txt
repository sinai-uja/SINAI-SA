        Best Camera for the price, September 27, 2006
        ByRobert Worlledge  - See all my reviews
We bought this camera before our vacation to Alaska.  I researched several before purchasing and decided on this one based on the reviews and the fact that it had the 10x zoom.  I cannot tell you how happy we are with this camera.. it is amazing.  We took almost 500 pictures in Alaska and our family and friends think the pictures look like postcards.  Other relatives on our trip had other models of digital cameras and their pictures did not compare to the quality of the ones we took.   My mother-in-law and sister-in-law have now asked for this camera for Christmas.  Great product, would recommend to anyone.
