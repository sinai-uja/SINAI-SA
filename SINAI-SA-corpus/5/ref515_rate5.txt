This is a nice camera for the beginner to the advance user. I'm not a tall person, so in a crowd, it nice to be able to reach up with the camera above my head to take photos and actually see the screen.  The one thing I would like, but this camera does not has this capability, is image stabilization but for the price, you can't beat it.  An ISO above 800 would be nice and so would having RAW but then again, it would drive the price up.  It's a great point and shoot camera.  Don't recommending buying the Canon recommended Power Shot case as it is a tight fit and is just barely able to close.  Don't know what Canon thinking when they recommended the Power Shot Case.
