        Great camera, December 22, 2008
        ByAmie J. Tacka "tick-tack" (Philadelphia, PA)  - See all my reviews
I've had 3 different cameras in the last 2 years - it's a long story.  I did a lot of research this time before picking a new one.  This little camera is really great and all the reviews were right on.  It takes great pictures and the quality is better than any of my previous cameras.  It is easy to use and really good in terms of battery life.  I don't think I will ever use some of the features but they are fun to experiment with.  I've recommended this camera to 2 co-workers and would recommend it to anyone who needs a great camera at a great price.
