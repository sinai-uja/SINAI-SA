We love this camera.  It is great for water vacations as you can take it in the water with you, take underwater pictures, etc.  The kids have taken it with them to sporting events and it has started raining and were the only ones that didn't have to hurry to put their cameras in a waterproof case!  It is sturdy and durable and very easy to use.  We had bought one for both of our daughters and couldn't resist getting one for ourselves because they loved theirs so much!  We are a 3 Olympus Stylus 1030SW family!!!
