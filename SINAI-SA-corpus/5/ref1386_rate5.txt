        Wonderful all around Camera, March 9, 2006
        ByV. Loveland (Idaho Falls, ID United States)  - See all my reviews
I read many reviews and chose the Kodak z740, I'm very glad I did, got the 1 gig memory card also and found I can shoot up to an hour in video!This is my 3rd digital camera, 1st was Olympus, 2nd Minolta.  I was looking for something that took the picture NOW!  As opposed to 3 seconds later.  Being a parent, this was very important to me.  Decent picture quality and very easy to use, this camera is a real treasure, I haven't found another camera with 10x zoom and this picture taking speed for this price.It acts alot like my old SLR's.  Push the button halfway down to focus, and then the rest of the way to take the picture.  No waiting, it takes the picture right away!Thank You Kodak!!!  My suggestions would be to get a uv filter to protect the lens and a 1 gig card if you need video.  For my Son's 22nd birthday I recorded his reaction to another video about him and it was downloaded into my daughters laptop in minutes!  Very easy to share and transfer files.Would buy it again!!
