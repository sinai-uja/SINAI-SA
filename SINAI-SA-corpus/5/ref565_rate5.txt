Good image definition, reasonable 4x optical zoom, filming capability, flexible power source, established brand.This is a camera for amateur photographers that nonetheless offers interesting shooting possibilities. You can use regular batteries in it or buy the rechargeable battery pack for a few more bucks. My advice is that you should buy the battery pack and take regular batteries with you when traveling to far, isolated places where electricity is not available. And for those like me who do not like to use digital zooming, the 8-megapixel definition allows you to extend the power of the 4x optical zoom as it offers great picture cropping possibilities without lessening the quality of 5x7 inch prints.
