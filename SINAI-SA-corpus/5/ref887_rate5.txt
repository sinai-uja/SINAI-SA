I already own a Powershot G2 and bought it many years ago.  It has been a wonderful camera, but big and heavy to carry around, so I wanted another Canon that I could carry everywhere. So after thinking about it for some time, bought the elph.  I have only had it for a month but I love it.  Have it in my purse and it is so easy to just whip it out.  It takes great pictures and videos.  I reccommend it for anyone that wants to take great pictures at the drop of a hat.  Right now I haven't encountered any negatives with this camera.
