        For the advanced amateur or someone who wants to be one, May 8, 2003

As many people have noted elsewhere, this is a camera for people who  know about photography. The range of choices in the 5700 for exposure, contrast, focus and all the other things that affect the quality of a photograph, make it an excellent choice for the advanced amateur. None of the other prosumer digital cameras can match the 5700 in features. But I found it was also a great choice for a wanna-be prosumer like me, since the large number of choices allows one to learn about photography by firing away a hundred photos at different settings, then seeing how the choices affect the results (the EXIF data, which tells what exposure, contrast, shutter speed and a whole bunch of other settings were used in taking a particular photograph, are saved with each picture).  Unlike similar strategies in the film camera world, this costs almost nothing, since the cost of taking a photo with a digital camera is about zero.  Point and shoot is easy, but you don't learn anything when that is all you do.The weakest feature is low light focus (more accurately,low contrast focus).  Weakest, that is, if the photographer does not know how to use some easy techniques to help solve it.  Its not as bad as some would claim.Especially strong features to me are the general quality of the photos, the excellent macro (closeup) shot capability, the 8X telephoto capability, the relatively compact size, the continuous shot feature, which takes rapid multiple shots for as long as you keep the button pressed, the "best shot selector", which selects the sharpest photo out of many under adverse shooting situations and saves only that photo to the card (this is a feature found in no other camera) and auto "bracketing", which allows successive shots at different exposures when you don't know which exposure setting might be the best.I've had the camera for about 6 months now and taken thousands of pictures.  Learned something about photography from almost every one...
