        Great camera, great price, April 22, 2007

I stepped up to this model from a PowerShot A70, and was pleased to find that basic operation was pretty much the same as the A70, allowing me to get up to speed with it in a very short time.  In size, the A630 is even larger than the A70, but that's not a drawback for me as it still fits conveniently in my pocket.  It uses four AAs, like the A70, and its hefty feel adds camera stability when longer shutter times are called for.  The 8 mega pixel images are a vast improvement over the A70's 3.2 mega pixels, with incredibly precise resolution possible, especially in well lighted images.  These images run between 5 and 6 megs each, but the 1 gigabyte data card I bought with it still holds over 200 of them (or many hundreds of smaller pictures), so that's not a problem either.  I like the option of complete manual operation, but also appreciate being able to take lots of fast snapshots on auto with some expectation of getting usable pictures.  The flash is stronger than the A70's, so I'm looking forward to using it underground on caving trips.  Redeye is still a problem, even with the redeye reduction pre-flash.  I'm getting better at PhotoShopping it out.  One thing I really like is the fact that this camera will do its thing the instant you press the shutter button, like an SLR, so if you're trying to put a speeding diesel locomotive right in the center of the frame, you don't have to lead your target or compensate for any time lag.  One of the best features of this model is its pricepoint - amazingly low for what you get.  I say, if you don't mind its size, go for it.
