        Excellent Purchase, September 25, 2005

I love this camera!  I have a large family and it always seems either someone forgets their camera, or they are the only ones who ever get to see the pictures - by the time they get developed it has been several months and no one cares any more.  Anyway, the prints are excellent - clear and bright.  The whole kit is perfect for someone who is out and about and likes their results quickly.  I can't say enough good about this purchase.  Even my husband who has a camera more than three times the price thinks this has been an excellent purchase.  I will say the paper you have to use in the printer dock is more than just a little pricey.  I suppose that is the most negative thing I can come up with.  So enjoy!
