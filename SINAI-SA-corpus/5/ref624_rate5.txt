This camera is great! The large flip screen is very useful if photographing near the ground, over head, or for photographing yourself. Ergonomically excellent for a person with larger hands. This camera has lots of features and apparently can take it too. I often shoot over 500 pictures a week with it. Sometimes far more. I take it everywhere. See my photos in the customer images to know why I love this camera!
