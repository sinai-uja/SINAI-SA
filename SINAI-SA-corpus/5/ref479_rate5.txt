        Digital camera veteren friends are jealous, April 16, 2007
        ByD. Wade "writer guy" (Atlanta, GA   USA)  - See all my reviews
We chose the Canon A630 because it (and it's sister camera, the A620) received rave reviews via several web sites and Consumer Reports. I've only had this camera a few weeks but we really like it.  This is our first digital camera, so we don't have much to compare it to.  But we've had two separate occassions where people who have used digital cameras for a while pick ours up to play with it, and say how much they like it.The viewfinder is very nice, the zoom surprisenly good, the video and sound quality also better than I would have thought (and I own a video business).  Do consider that the card that comes with it held five photos at most, but we found a 2 gig card at a warehouse club for less than $30.  The flash doesn't always go off, but it appears that the photos without flash didn't need the flash.  Very simple to use.  A friend also likes the hand grip.  It's not light and wouldn't fit in your pocket, but we found that it easily fit into a standard camera case that fits on a belt.  Very easy to transfer to the computer. Again, it's only been used a few times, so we have not played with photo quality or printing photos, but so far I would definately recommend the A630 for the money.
