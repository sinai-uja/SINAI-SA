        Great Little Camera, January 12, 2009

I bought this to take with me to Europe. I wanted something I could put in my purse or pocket. It took great pictures, was easy to use, the battery lasted longer than any of the other camera batteries (I was with 4 other people). I took an extra battery, so I always had one charged. I dropped this camera numerous times and it just kept on clicking. Each night we would upload the pics off of all 4 cameras onto a computer and my pics were by far the best quality.
