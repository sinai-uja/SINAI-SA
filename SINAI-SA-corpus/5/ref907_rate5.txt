        Great camera to take everywhere!, February 8, 2009
        ByMA Lew... (Ephrata, PA USA)  - See all my reviews
This is a great little camera to take along - everywhere!  I have had an SD400 for the past several years, and my husband wanted to take that one to keep at work for documenting his manufacturing plant.  So...I gave him mine - and bought the SD1100 IS!  I love it so far!  I love the image stabilization feature.  My SD400 never gave me any problems and took great pictures - I expect the SD1100 IS will do the same.So far - so good!  :-)
