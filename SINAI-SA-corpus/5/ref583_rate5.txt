        Great camera with great features and nominal price, September 19, 2007

I own this product for over 2 months now and feel this is the best point-and-shoot in this range. Actually there cannot be anymore improvements in this already ideal camera.Be it macro mode, or normal mode every shot promises more than what you preview or review. Why I say so? The LCD screen doesn't give the real picture, with its average resolution.The camera has a turning LCD screen which gives you more freedom with angles and views.The camera might be a bit heavy, and definitely not a pocket sized one, but that is probably its advantage. You get a solid feeling holding it.Its just an amazing camera in all aspects, except for low light photography. The images are not quite sharp in low light, probably because of the absence of image stabilizer.Other than that, I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about it.
