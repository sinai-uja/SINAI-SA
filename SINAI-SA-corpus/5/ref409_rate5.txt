        Just what I was looking for, December 17, 2006
        ByM. Davis (SD)  - See all my reviews
I think I looked at every camera on the Amazon site and figured out and compared each one to decide which one to buy.  I finally decided that I needed a camera that used AA batteries and used a SD card.  So then I started comparing the Canons and reading the reviews.  I couldn't figure out why the A630 cost about the same as the A620, so decided to buy the one with the most pixels.  As you can tell, I am not a camera expert; but, just an ordinary person wanting to take pictures that are above ordinary.I had a cheap digital camera before that just wouldn't take pictures inside.  I could put them in a photo software program and lighten them up a bit, but they just weren't good quality.A lot of my pictures are taken indoors of kids,people and pets.  No one ever shows those pictures when they post them as an example though.  I was very concerned that if I got a new camera, it wouldn't be too much different.Thank goodness the Canon A630 takes great indoor pictures even in my low- light living room.  It is absolutely amazing.  I have a 14x30 ft. living room dining room combination and when I take a picture at night on on endof the room, the other end of the room shows up well lit up too.There are lots of digital cameras out there that don't take good indoor pictures.  This camera is not one of them.  I'm so happy I decided on the Canon A630.  I can hardly wait to take Christmas pictures with it!  I know they will be great.
