        Powerful Power Shot, May 5, 2007
        ByDAB  - See all my reviews
Just got this camera yesterday after doing extensive research and comparisons with other brands etc. Though it does not have the image stabilizer touted by some of the other canons, many of the shooting modes offer this option which I think is pretty cool. I am still getting to know the camera but so far its been great and has taken some awesome photos. I think for the price its definitely a great value.
