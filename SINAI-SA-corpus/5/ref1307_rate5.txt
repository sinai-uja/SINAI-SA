        Love The Camera, But LCD Screen Failed, March 6, 2007

I have a similar issue as another reviewer had... my Z740's LCD screen failed a few months ago. I turn on the camera and all the screen shows is solid white. The little eye-piece viewfinder still displays fine, and the pictures & videos still come out fine, but I can't use the lcd screen as my viewfinder any more... which was one of the biggest reasons I bought the camera...Others online have had this problem, but I can't find anyone who has gotten it resolved. My camera is well out of warranty, so I have no hope of Kodak fixing it.Otherwise though, it's a great camera... very impressive actually. I just wish it hadn't died after a year and a half of occasional use... :-(
