        Excellent Value, August 12, 2008

I knew I wanted a 50mm/1.4 lens for baby portraits (main excuse for getting a DSLR). Compared different offerings from Canon, Nikon, Sony etc. When paired with a 50mm/1.4 lens, nothing could beat this in value and features. Shake reduction combined with a fast lens means great indoor shots without the use of flash and extremely shallow depth of field. I haven't been out much to test the kit lens (hard to do when you have an infant), but a few test shots looked good. Only draw back is that it didn't include rechargeable batteries with a charger, but it's easy enough to find AA rechargeables.
