My husband bought me a camera a few years back. It was a fuji. 2.0 pixel so I couldn't blow the pictures up bigger than 4x6 and it look good. My mother-in-law bought her husband the Canon A570 I think and I loved the camera. I am into a little money last month so I did a little research. Amazon had the camera cheaper than everyone. Walmart,office depot, kmart,and best buy. Prices range between $249-399. The camera came with everthing I needed. This is the best camera!!!!!!
