        One of the best!, December 12, 2008

Compared to my previous three digital cameras, the last one also a Canon Powershot, the Canon PowerShot SD1100 Elph has a much higher pixel count, an optical zoom, image stabilization, face recognition for focus and much more compact size. The price is reasonable for what you get. I haven't even tried the video mode. This also is the first digital camera I feel comfortable carrying around in my pocket as easily as a cell phone.
