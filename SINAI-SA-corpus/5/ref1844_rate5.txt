I do photography as a hobby for over 20 years. I love Pentax cameras because the lightness and for the lens compatibility and this is the best SLR I have ever had. I still need to test some of its features. But I am very happy with the quality of the pictures. I upgraded from istDS that I got two years back. The shake reduction come very useful when I take pictures of my 2 year old son who can not stay at one place. I used to get many blurred images with ist DS at low shutter speeds and this camera handles that very well. The colors are very natural and I like the fact that I can save images in both RAW and JPEG at the same time. I usually use RAW to store my images and JPEG for the web and email. The image processor may not be as good as what u may find in Nikon or Canon but the RAW images are very impressive. I think I finally got the right camera to really replace my older film based Pentax SLR and still I can use all those expensive lenses I have without having to spend more money. If u are an owner of Pentax SLR with many lenses and wants to go digital, there is no better choice than K10D unless u have a lot of money to invest on a camera and new lenses.
