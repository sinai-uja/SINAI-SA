        great little point-and-shoot camera, 5 star bargain, November 11, 2008

got this camera for days when I don't want to haul around my quite large 40D/17-55mm f2.8 outfit, and for air travel. The 590IS was very nice surprise; the images are decent considering negligible camera weight and size, IS functions well, but most importantly, the manual controls are well laid out and easy to access. I generally adjust exposures by at least -1/3 stop for better highlights, and such exposure compensation as well as manual flash on/off etc is right at your fingertips. I was worried that AA batteries will go too fast, but no, the power consumption is not too bad either. I still bought rechargables though. I'm going to buy one more 590IS, left my original one at different location for use there. I bought more luxurious/more expensive 1100IS for my wife some time ago, and in my opinion the 590IS is much better overall.
