        Awesome Manual and Auto Features...GREAT Camera!, November 30, 2007
        ByS. Watson (San Diego, CA)  - See all my reviews
Whether you are a first time buyer or not, this camera is excellent! It is comfortable to hold, and won't slip out of your hand.Pros -Movable LCD which makes self-portraits easy -Good zoom (digital zoom looks bad in LCD, but if image is focused the picture turns out fine) -MANY manual options which are quite fun to play with (eg. shutter speed as slow as 15 sec. which can make a shot at night look like one taken during the afternoon, drive feature which takes about three pictures per second as long as the shutter button is depressed in this mode)  -Easy to use Auto functions -Video editing feature on camera when in playback mode -The four batteries last very long -Sensor which detects when you move the camera, allowing LCD to go to a standby mode which will turn back on once camera is moved again (saves battery power) -Many, many other featuresCons -Slow zoom on video mode -Only digital zoom on video mode; low quality video when zoomed in a lot (but good quality when zoomed out all the way) -High quality pictures (actually a pro, but makes emailing pics as attachments limited because of the 8 MegaPixels)This camera has lasted me half a year so far and has done nothing but satisfy me while I've owned it. I would DEFINITELY recommend the Powershot A630 to anyone who wants an awesome camera.
