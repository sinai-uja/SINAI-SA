        awesome little camera, January 29, 2009

I bought this camera because I wanted a small digital that would allow me to take great photo's without requiring a loan to buy the camera. I have had had a 2000 35mm Cannon EOS which has been an excellent camera but I wanted something more compact which would allow me to have a camera available without lugging around a heavy, large case.  The PowerShot A590IS has been the perfect choice for my needs. I took it out for the first time last week to really take some photo's and I got many beautiful shots of my niece at sunset. I haven't had the chance to get really creative with it, right now I'm just trying to learn the basics of the camera and that has been an easy and enjoyable task.
