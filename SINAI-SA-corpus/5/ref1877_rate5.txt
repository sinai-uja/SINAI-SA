I absolutely love this camera! In December of '07 I decided to purchase a K10D but then I heard a rumor that Pentax was coming out with a new line of cameras at PMA. After tons of research I realized that the K200D has the same sensor as the K10D but in a smaller package and redesigned software for beginning photographers. I purchased this camera the second it became available on amazon and I have never regretted it. It's hard to believe that a camera in this price range is this well built, has in body shake reduction, depth of field preview (screen by default, viewfinder via setting change), 11-point AF, advanced metering, and the list goes on.The kit lens is great but I soon purchased an after market Tamron 70-300 also from amazon. Nothing on the market comes close to the value of this camera.Tip: This camera really benefits from a fast SD card. I use the SanDisk Extreme III 4GB.-David
