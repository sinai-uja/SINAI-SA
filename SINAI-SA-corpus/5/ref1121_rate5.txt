I was unprepared for the beauty of this camera. My earlier Powershot was 4 years old. The improvements are remarkable. The pictures are clear, the viewfinder is bright and the range of controls are great. I'm not into photography anymore and this unit suits me fine. I chose this one based on reviews I read on Amazon and elsewhere. I don't regret my choice at all. I am very satisfied.
