        YOUR LAST DIGITAL CAMERA, June 15, 2003
        ByOILMAN "OWEN" (bayside, new york United States)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera about 6 months ago, And I must say that aside from a few minor draw backs, This camera will fullfil all the expectations that you have for a digital camera, However this camera is not for the average user, You must read the manualand once thats done read it again, and keep it within arms reach for reference  untill you get use to all the wonderful features of this semi pro camera.
