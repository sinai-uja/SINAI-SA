I'm a soldier over in Afghanistan and I have to say that this is the perfect camera for this enviroment.  The camera's durability, especially it's toughness and ability to keep out dust or in my case sand is perfect.  I also really like it's setting that allows you to take pictures when your moving and have the picture come out clear.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.
