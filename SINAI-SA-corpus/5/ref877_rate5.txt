        BATTERY & CHARGER INCLUDED, February 10, 2009
        BySue Autumn (Brooklyn, NY USA)  - See all my reviews
I did not yet buy this product (although I probably will within the hour!) but I'd like to help out some other customers who are shopping for a camera. It was not clear to me that the battery and charger are included and I had to look through a couple of customer reviews until I found one that informed me of this important fact. Thanks to John P. Robertson who writes, "I have... two spare Lenmar batteries in addition to the Canon battery that came with the camera." That helped me with the info that a BATTERY is included. For the info about the charger, I thank Lynn H. Pierson who writes, "It was not clear to me on Amazon that the camera came with a recharger (IT DID)..." I hope this review is helpful to others.
