My wife has the habit of sitting on cameras and cell phones or putting them through the washer. I bought this camera for that reason. She loves the camera. It does great macros of her flowers and great all around shots. It is the first electronic item that she has found easy to operate. For what I bought it for is gets 5 stars.
