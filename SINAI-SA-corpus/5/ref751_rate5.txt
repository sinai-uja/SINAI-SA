        Best Camera so far..., April 7, 2008
        ByC. Moore "Jomimo" (Germany)  - See all my reviews
I have been buying Canon for years. I have had about 6 different cameras (back luck with them - not from Canon but my daughter!) I originally bought this one becasue I love pink. As soon as I got it I was shocked to see how much it does do. In the descriptions, it does not tell you all it can do. I had the model prior to this one and I loved it. However, this one is better, cheaper, and does more! I reccommend this to all!
