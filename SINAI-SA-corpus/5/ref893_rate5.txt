I got this camera for my son after purchasing one just like it for myself.  My son is thrilled with his camera. We just got back from a trip to Japan, where we literally took hundreds of pictures.  I picked up my prints today and couldn't be happier.  This camera is a great size.  It fit easily in my purse and is so easy to use.  The pictures turned out fantastic.  I would highly recommend this camera.
