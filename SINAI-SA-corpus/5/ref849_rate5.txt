        FINALLY!, July 11, 2008
        ByClaudia J. Ochoa  - See all my reviews
i have always been a canon user until i got these rave reviews about the samsung NV10 so i bought it. i did not like that i could not just point and shoot a good pic. i had always had to play with it for a while (i know this is not a review for NV10) but with that being said once i decided to back to canon and see what the SD1100 was about...i had NO regrets! this camera takes AMAZING pics! with very little navigation too! the macro option is really cool too!it did have an screen error message after a week and half of using it but that is the AMAZING thing about AMAZON, returned it and they sent me a new one...just like that!if i could give more stars i would! i am inspired to take pictures again!!
