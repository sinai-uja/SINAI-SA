I am very impressed with the quality of this camera! Amazon has it for an amazing price as well. I went to Target and Walmart and they had the same exact camera for 299.00! I recently got my pictures developed and they were very high quality pictures. It takes awhile to figure out all the different settings on the camera, but is worth getting. This is the best digital camera that I have ever owned. I used to have a Kodak easy share and this camera puts the Kodak ones to shame. I highly recommend!
