this camera is great. it's a wonderful overall do anything camera.  I have a sony cybershot and also a cannon digital camera and features wise, this one rocks.  it has so many pluses, let me just go over the parts i didn't like.1.wrist strap.  i wish they would of gave us a locking wrist strap. i mean come on! this is supposed to go anywhere.2.water bubbles. i was taking some videos in the water ( a river) and noticed when i switched to picture mode that there was huge watter bubble right in the middle of the lens!!!3.no video zooming.  no video zooming, this sucks, i want to be able to zoom when i take video, is that soo hard!!!4.panorama mode blurs. I love panorama mode, but half the time it will mess up.  it just takes soo long, and when it does mess up, i just delete the picture and I don't feel like retaking it... maybe the free space isn't a bad thing.5. xd card. i hate xd cards, and now i want to get the high speed card just to take 30fps video... oh well, i guess i will live with the lower speed.well, those are the only negatives i can think of.  if this camera survives the ocoee river (rafting trip) i will post back another review. all in all, it is a great purchase, especially if you often do watersports.
