I was looking at this camera and thought it looked a little bit bad, so i read more reviews and it seemed alright so i went ahead and bought it.  i opened the box and charged it right away i got it all charged and started taking pictures. I was stunned by the quality of the picture. THIS IS A FIVE STAR ITEM!!!!!!!WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!
