        5 stars if you need waterproof feature, otherwise 3 stars, September 8, 2008

I have used this camera in the pool and in the water park for many times and it has worked great. No leaks or any other problems. Picture quality is average/mediocre compared to other digital cameras in the same price range at around $300+ (I also own a canon S2IS for non-water use, for it takes much better pictures even though it is a couple generations older). The wide-angle lens is great and I think this alone is well worth the $50 price difference between this and the 850SW. It takes some getting used to to hold the camera properly without touching the lens. The lens is kind of difficult to clean (especially when you get sunscreen "grease" on it). Video quality is ok but the microphone/voice quality is not good. It's hard to get good sound out of it because it is on the side of the camera where you hold it rather than on the front of the camera. The slideshow playback on the large LCD screen makes it a great "toy" for my toddler (I don't need to worry about the camera being dropped and abused). If you definitely need the waterproof feature, this camera will not disappoint. If that's optional and you primarily want great pictures, then there are a lot of other better cameras out there to choose from. BTW, replace the strap with a Wii strap so you won't have to worry about losing the camera in the water!
