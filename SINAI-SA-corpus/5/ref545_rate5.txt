        I love my camera!, May 12, 2007
        ByS. Ballard (Phoenix, AZ)  - See all my reviews
I've had my Canon A630 now for a month and am very happy with its ease of use and performance.  I do not like small lite weight cameras.  This one definitely has substance.  I think the weight and size are perfect.  My last camera had 4MP and I can sure tell a difference in the pictures taken with this one.  They are amazing!  Before I purchased this camera I read a lot of reviews saying that it was difficult to hold this camera steady so the picture wouldn't be shaky. The instructions tell you to change the ISO setting so you won't have this problem.  I did this and have never experienced a shaky picture.  This camera has my highest recommendation.
