This camera is an Awesome Digital.  I got this camera as an upgrade from my old HP.  I must say I am completely satisfied.  It takes brilliant pictures and I print mine on an old HP Photosmart printer and they are awesome.  It has a lot of features I don't even use, I keep it on Auto but I like the fact I can set it to take the red eye out as it snaps the picture.  If you are on the fence you won't be disappointed.  I bought this off pure reviews and I am so glad I did!!!  It is even cheaper now than when I bought it 2 months ago.  Can't beat it!!!
