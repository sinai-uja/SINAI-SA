I am so happy with this camera. I got it in brown and the color is GORGEOUS. I'm completely an amateur but the pictures come out AWESOME, very clear, even from a far distance. I went to a comedy show and was watching from somewhat far but the zoom made it look like I was only a few rows away!! Also, it takes great video.Totally worth it, and I was able to get a great memory card on sale at Circuit City. SO HAPPY!
