We took this camera on vacation, and the shots we got looked professional. Very user-friendly. The "kids and pets" setting lets you take great pictures even when there is a lot of activity- no blurs. My sister-in-law is a semi-professional photographer, and she is now going to buy one after seeing how fantastic our photos came out. I highly recommend this camera!!
