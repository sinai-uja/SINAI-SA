        ByHuber Segura "micky mouse" (streamwood  , IL.)  - See all my reviews
 this is the best camera that i hadThis camera offers strong features for a "take it anywhere" camera - water PROOF (to 30 feet) drop proof (to 6 feet) and dust proof. After a month of dragging it everywhere, I think the claims are real. I've gotten it soaked, dropped it, and been in wind-blown dirt without any damage or crud appearing on my shots. The camera also offers numerous metering modes for shooting. The auto exposure is current with today's best camera that i had. Once you learn the menu system, you can get a good shot almost anywhere, and the default setting works well almost anywhere.  1. There is NO finder window, you MUST use the view screen to frame your shot. It's awkward for those of us accustomed to a view finder. But I've learned...2. The menus are not complex, but there are a lot of options. There are settings that work for "instant" shots. But for more challenging situations there are great options - especially useful is the "portrait flash" options that let you highlight a face while not losing the background. It actually works as advertised. 3. The lens is limited in aperture. This type of camera does not let you stop down to f/11 for that "perfect" depth of field shot. You are shooting around f/5 and changing the exposure time as you select different settings. What it sees is what you get. 4. It's small. I have several great shots -- that feature my finger over the left 1/3 of the lens. 5. it has the usual metering delay of P&S - so you can't take a TRULY instant shot - but there IS a feature called SHOOT&SELECT - which takes about 8 shots in "motor drive" mode - you then pick one or more that you want to keep. (you must do it NOW - before going on to the next shot, and it does take a moment for them to save.) But for action shots of kids, its fun and works well.
