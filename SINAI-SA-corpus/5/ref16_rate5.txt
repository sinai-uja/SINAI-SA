        Great Point and Shoot Camera, May 11, 2008
        ByMonshroud  - See all my reviews
So I was looking for something with slightly more features then a cheap point and shoot camera.  I used to have an older Canon and thought I would give them a try again, and I have to say I am rather pleased with my purchase.  The camera turns on and is ready to take picutres quickly.  The Auto mode is great for most daylight or well lit settings. The 'Night-Scene' Mode works great if you are taking picutres during the night or in a dim room.  Colors are vibrant and crisp, and the image stabilization works rather well when using the zoom.  I really like all the available customization options for Exposure and and White Balance, that helps if you know a bit about what you are doing and want to take some specialized shots, which is exactly what I was looking for.I only have one thing that I don't like so far about the camera.  I would have liked something more then just a 4x Optical Zoom.  A 6x or 8x would have been a lot nicer, although you can purchase additional lenses for this, which is a great option.  However, this seems to be more of an issue with all point and shoot type digital cameras, not something specific to this camera.Overall a great value for what you get.
