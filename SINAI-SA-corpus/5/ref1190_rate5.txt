        Great still camera with video mode at great price., October 5, 2007

I originally bought this camera at Walmart for about $230, then I came home and saw it was $180 at amazon; so I returned it to Walmart and started over at amazon.I am so happy with this purchase.  I have a really high-end, although now outdated, Olympus, and I have been a loyal Olympus customer for years, but as I looked to upgrade to a higher MP camera, I realized that I could not justify staying in the same price range as my previous cameras.And I don't regret the decision for a second.  I have had this camera for about a month, and it has come in handy (it is also much smaller than my previous cameras) on many occasions.  I recently was able to make a great video of my friend's daughter going for her first colored belt in Tae Kwon Do.  The camera worked great for video in this type of circumstance (once I learned to keep my hand away from the microphone.)  I honestly can't imagine having much reason to use the video camera that I paid hundreds for a couple of years ago again.Still picture quality is obviously great with 10MP and stabilization.
