I'm thrilled to be using a Canon point-and-shoot again. The settings are easy to access and utilize and the quality of the photos is fantastic. I was able to pick the camera up and use all of the functions without referencing the manual; everything is laid out very user-friendly. The quality of the photos is great, the size of the camera is great, the price is great...I'd recommend this point-and-shoot to anyone!
