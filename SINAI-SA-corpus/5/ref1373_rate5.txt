        AMAZING CAMERA!!, October 26, 2005
        BySteve Shalaby  - See all my reviews
THE 10X OPTICAL ZOOM IS UNBELIEVABLE. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF CONFUSING THE MUCH CLEARER OPTICAL ZOOM, FOR THE FUZZY "DIGITAL" ZOOM, THAT OTHER MANUFACTURERS TRY TO COMPARE TO. THE DIGITAL ZOOM IS VIRTUALLY USELESS! THIS CAMERA EVEN HAS AN INTERNAL MEMORY, SO IF YOU FORGET YOUR CARD, YOU CAN STILL TAKE PICTURES! IT TAKES PRETTY DECENT VIDEO WITH SOUND, AND IT'S BATTERY CONSUMPTION IS UNHEARD OF! (I'VE HAD MY CAMERA NOW FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS, I'VE USED IT ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND SINCE THEN, AND HAVE ONLY REPLACED THE BATTERIES ONCE!!)
