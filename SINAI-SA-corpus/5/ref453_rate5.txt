I bought this camera for my sister and had a chance to see it while she stayed with me. It is an great camera for beginners. Good resolution, easy use. We especially loved the fact that it has a cable to the TV and we could watch the sightseeing pictures with the whole family.You'll have to buy a memory card though because the one which comes with the camera isn't enough.
