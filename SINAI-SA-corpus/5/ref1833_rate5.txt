Impressive camera with a price that cannot be beaten. The fact that you can use any Pentax lens ever made is fantastic. Having been a Pentax customer for 25 year I certainly appreciate it. The only weak feature is the built in flash. I find it almost unusable for pictures just few feet away so plan to invest in an add-on flash. Standard Battery life is very good and you can find a replacement for few dollars on the internet for some extra shots. Overall an excellent product made by a company that cares about its customers. Buy it with the confidence that you will not regret it.
