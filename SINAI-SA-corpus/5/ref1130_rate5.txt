        By10za "10za" (Alpharetta, GA USA)  - See all my reviews
I got this camera as a replacement after losing a 3.2 Kodak...I am very happy with this camera, which I received as a gift. I have own two digital cameras in the past and this is the best by far.The only minus is that the zoom is difficult to use and you must hold the camera very steady.Pluses... Battery seems to last longer than mostPicture quality is fantastic. I have blown many up and they look greatYou get nice short video with audio and you can hear the playback wellWorks well indoors and outdoorsVery easy to useEasy to download picturesGreat for enlargementsWho ever designed this camera did an excellent job. It is so easy to use and the pictures are of excellent quality.
