We searched the market for the best price and best product and this was the winner - and now after using it for a few weeks I can confirm that it is a GREAT camera, much better than the last one our daughter dropped on the rocks. The zoom is fabulous, the controls are easy to navigate and there are remarkable options for shooting manually to adjust light, apeture and other things I havent had the time to address. I use this camera for casual shooting as well as professional photos of my jewelry and I find it performs fabulously in both respects. I am also impressed with the video capabilities. We have taken some great shorts of our daughter with it.
