        One terrific camera, May 23, 2003
        ByK. Mooney (Springfield, MA USA)  - See all my reviews
Although I am pretty familiar with Nikon's digital controls having owned a Coolpix 880, I recommend spending some time with the instruction manual:  Not because I think the camera is that complicated, but so that you can fully appreciate what the 5700 can do!  This is an excellent camera if you really want a digital SLR but can't justify the cost; the 5700's electronic viewfinder behaves like a true SLR while the 8x optical zoom (not digital, which is nearly worthless) covers most lens focal lengths.I love my film cameras (also Nikon), but there are many advantages to owning a digital camera.  Not only can you see your results right away, but the digital nature has some cool advantages - want to shoot in B&W?  Don't change film, just change a camera setting.  The viewfinder in the 5700 will also show in B&W!  That's pretty cool.  At a decent resolution with moderate compression, I can get 1,100 images on a ... 256 MB card.  Yes, that's one thousand one hundred - at a quality that will produce a very decent 8x10 print.  How many rolls of film is that?Of course the Nikon quality is exceptional, from the ED glass in the optics to the very strong alloy body.  I do not feel that the size is too small, but I do find the positioning of the right camera strap a wee bit awkward.  If you do consider digital, with the 5700 or not, I do recommend buying extra memory cards - the prices are low and the 16 to 32 MB cards that usually come with the camera will fill too quickly, especially if you want to use the full 5 MP resolution.  Also, battery life is a problem.  Buying those ... lithium batteries for the 880 (same battery as the 5700) nearly bankrupted me until I bought Nikon's rechargable battery system (which the 5700 comes with - kudos to Nikon).  Buy an extra battery or two - you will not regret it!  Indeed, shell out the bucks for the 5700, you won't regret that either.
