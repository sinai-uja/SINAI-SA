Bought mine about three weeks ago. I love it and it is fairly simple to use. The instuctions with it are a bit vague. However you can figure it out. I would suggest that when you puchase the camera, that you buy a protective bag for it so as not to damage or scratch the LCD screen. Takes great photos though. I think it was worth the money spent for it.
