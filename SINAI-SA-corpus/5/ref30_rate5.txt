        Great every day and snapshot camera, February 21, 2009

This little camera is great for anyone on the go needing easy, quick pics and portability.  As a professional photographer, there are times when the large DSLR is just too much to lug around for informal snapshots or short trips via air with carry on only.  My only complaints - it has a slow recovery when shooting flash pictures and fill flash is not user friendly to activate for backlit pics.  However for the price it is hard to beat with great optics and overall ease of use.
