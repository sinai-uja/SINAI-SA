I researched the heck out of this camera before buying it....it's purpose was for our Disney trip, specifically the water parks.  I tried it out at home in the pool and just love this camera.  People are amazed at the underwater videos I've taken, and the pictures come out great too.  Not so good on maximum zoom in low light, but that's the only complaint.  I got a 8gb microsd and came home from florida with 300 hundred photos and a TON of video, with a ton of memory to spare.  This camera has given us video memories that NO OTHER little camera would do.  My only suggestion is to keep an eye on the lens if you're using it in the water.  Sometimes a droplet of water will stay on the lens and show up on subsequent pictures.  I just blow on it to get rid of any water.  No viewfinder is really no problem....I haven't used one since my first digi camera 10 years ago!!!  I feel bad for those who have had trouble with this camera, because for me, it's been amazing.
