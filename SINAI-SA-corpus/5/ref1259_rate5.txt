        Great camera, great price!, April 10, 2008
        ByA. Wilhelm (Central Illinois)  - See all my reviews
This camera does a lot for the money. It is easy to use and takes great pictures. I have read very little of the owners manual but am able to figure out the different settings because it is so easy to navigate.  The only thing I could possibly say negative is I have a difficult time with pictures in low light.  That being said, even when they don't turn out so good on the camera when I up load them to the software sent with the camera and do some editing with the light they look great! The red eye removal tool in the software works great also. The other day I took the camera to my sons band competition but forgot the video camera. I hadn't used the video feature of this camera yet so I was leary. It turned out wonderful! For the price I don't think you can go wrong with this camera.
