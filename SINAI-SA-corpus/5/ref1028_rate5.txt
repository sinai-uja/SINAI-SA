        Great camera for the money!!!, December 21, 2008
        ByCanon fan (Austin, Texas)  - See all my reviews
   I bought this camera for my wife. She wanted an easy to use point and shoot that delivers great pictures. She also wanted a compact size to drop in her purse so that it was with her at all times.   The Canon PoweShot SD1100IS filled the bill perfectly. I checked all brand of cameras in this range and read both user and expert reviews. I am a fan of having a viewfinder as are many who have ever tried to see an LCD under bright light conditions. Many cameras in the range do not offer viewfinders. I also liked the 4X optical zoom. I settled on this camera and it has been the perfect pick. It is as simple as anyone could want and still offers flexibility for those who want to have more control of their pictures.   I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting a basic point and shoot with great results.
