        You will never find a better camera for this price!, January 17, 2009
        ByJean Bell "jeanb_1" (Franklin Lakes, NJ USA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera for an upcoming vacation.  I figured for $100 I could drop it in the water, lose it, etc and not be upset since it was so cheap.  When it arrived, I was so surprised to see how great the photos came out, how easy it is to handle and how small it is.  I just cannot believe what a great deal this was.  Now, I am afraid to lose it!  Since other reviews have really hit on the specifics, I will only say that one of the most impressive features is the pet setting.  The only digital camera I own (I have 6 now) that could take photos of my cats without that awful white cat eye was my Canon EOS - in a completely different price range.  This camera takes photos even in the dark and my cats eyes are beautiful, just as if I took it in bright daylight!   What a fantastic deal!
