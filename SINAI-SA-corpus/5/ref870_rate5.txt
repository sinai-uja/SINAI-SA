        Perfect Camera For Lots Of Different Uses!, September 22, 2008
        ByMartin A Hogan "Marty From SF" (San Francisco, CA.)  - See all my reviews
I ruined my `Nikon 7900' 7.0 megapixel camera after three great years by getting it wet.  This was upsetting as I had the SCUBA encasement for that model and a ton of accessories.  My nephew turned me onto the `Canon SD1100' (as it also has an optional SCUBA encasement) and I am very happy.It has one more megapixel (8.0) capacity for crisper pictures (up to 16 X 22 prints), a larger 2.5-inch LCD monitor and tons of extras.  There is an "Optical Image Stabilizer" which reduces the blur of any camera movement, even with low light.  There is also a cool feature called, "Face Detection WB" which means the camera concentrates upon faces, then it calculates "white balance" for the best colors and tones.  You can also just select ONE face among the group to highlight (think Birthday parties)!There is a cool "red-eye" correction that identifies and corrects red-eye when pictures are taken.  You can also later detect and correct "red-eye" during image playback. The camera is smaller and thinner than my previous Nikon and it fits very easily into any pocket (be careful!).  It's quick, easy and responds readily.  It is a great value for the price.  The pictures are just as good (maybe better) than my old camera.  I can't wait to go diving now so I can try the underwater encasement (accessory).  You can also buy a less expensive underwater encasement accessory for up to 15 feet of depth for snorkeling and there is a waterproof encasement accessory for rainy day shooting.
