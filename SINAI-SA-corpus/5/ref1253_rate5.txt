        Refurbished verses Repaired, May 16, 2008

I recently got a new Camera for my birthday and I was rolling around with the dog and forgot I had it around my neck and broke the LED Screen.  I sent it to Precison Camera on the net for repair but was looking to buy a new one to replace the old one sad because I had only had it 2 months.  To my Suprise Precision Camera wanted $103.00 to replace the Led screen.  Amazon offered a refurbished camera, like new for a dollar less.  I got a new battery (I kept the old one) and only the box was open.  I was very please with Amazon and very disappointed in the repair cost.  So Amazon is the place to shop.
