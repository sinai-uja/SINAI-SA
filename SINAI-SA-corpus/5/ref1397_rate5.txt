        Great digital for outdoors/scenery, May 6, 2006

I bought this camera from Amazon just before a trip to South Africa and Namibia. Many of the photos are stunning - everyone I show them to asks "you took these pictures?" and  "what kind of camera do you have?" The 10x optical zoom is essential for animal shots and even gets some good bird shots. The zoom can also help to frame your landscape photos as well. It is also important to note that this camera can use AA batteries - important when traveling as you can not count on finding a place to recharge batteries or purchase non-standard batteries.As for cons, it does take this camera a bit long to startup. One might also consider paying more for image stabilization. I often keep a mini tri-pod attached when shooting to help stabilize - especailly important in low-light or when zoomed way in.Overall, for the price I think this camera deserves 5 stars.
