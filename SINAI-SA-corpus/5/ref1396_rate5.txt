After using the larger SLR Camera's for the past 30 years, I found this camera much more to my liking than the tiny digitals.Recently I spent 70 days in New Orleans, LA. on a construction work assignment and I got the opportunity in my free time to shoot hundreds of photos that all came out extremely professional-looking.  One memorable (Zoomed 10X) shot I took from my 6th floor window at the hotel where I stayed.  It was of the New Orleans skyline 9 miles in the distance rising out of the trees in the late afternoon light.  I had to shoot it at a 45 degree angle thru the window glass, and it still came out perfectly clear and sharp.  That would have been a feat even for my old Nikon SLR.   For the picture quality and ease of use this camera gives me, I can easily live with an errant lens cap.
