I bought this camera to use in conjuction with my Nikon SLR. It is small enough to be convenient to carry, yet takes very good pictures. The interface makes it relatively easy to use. The LCD is reasonably large and makes framing your shot pretty simple. The picture quality has been great. I'd highly reommend the camera.
