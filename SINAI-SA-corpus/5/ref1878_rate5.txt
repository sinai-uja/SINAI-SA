        Smooth transition from compact or bridge cameras, June 2, 2008
        ByHimi Jendrix "Himi Jendrix" (Stockholm, Sweden)  - See all my reviews
Spent several weeks researching the web and camera shops for my first DSLR. Have owned and frequently used 2 compacts: Canon S-45, Canon S-80 and a bridge Fuji S9500 prior to this. Starting the research with the "obvious" Canons and Nikons I ended up with a Pentax, mainly for its best value for money.  I opted for body only and ordered separataly a "walk-around  /universal lens" :Pentax DA 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 ED AL IF. Received the camera and lens from Amazon only recently and have shot first dozens of pictures. The first impressions are very good.Solid build, very good feel in my hands (that is of course subjective)and most of all the camera delivers exactly what I was hoping for. Unlike compact cameras, with this Pentax you can really decide over the depth of field and very easily do manual focusing. That is if you have time for it. If you don't, there is always the P option and also a few scene modes which are quite handy.The quality of the pictures is very good.I can really recommend this camera.I will get back when I gain more experience with it and get second (indoor) lens.
