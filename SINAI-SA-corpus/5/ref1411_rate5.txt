        Kodak lived up to its name, June 3, 2006
        ByPaul D. Edger "Paul D." (Davidsonville, MD USA)  - See all my reviews
I have not taken a lot of photos in my life, but my last digital camera was a cheap Olympus that my xgf's father got me for Christmas 2 years ago. The quality was so horrific and the battery was a pin. Now with the z740, it makes me wish I had this 2 years ago. The 10X zoom makes it easy to see images a long way away. I am able to caputre the beauty of deer and other outside landscapes and animals at great quality, and enlarging them does not affect the picture quality. This camera is great for beginners and experts. With the 23 different modes, it would be hard for you not to get a perfect shot unless one totally does not know what they are doing. It is easy to understand all the features within 5 minutes of reading the manual and having the hands-on approach. And taking movies are as good as using a digital video recorder. Some have dissed the camera saying it is not easy to use. It is a very good camera and great to use. If you are looking for a great prices camera for great shots, moving and still, and want to be able to take pictures with ease, this is the camera for you. You can attach it to the EasyShare Dock and print pictures in seconds. This is my second digital camera and hopefully the one that lasts me the longest until I graduate college.
