        ByIranderly Fernandes  - See all my reviews
I think that is the best digital camera produced until 2006.may be in the future we will see something beter but now...The pictures are perfect. It has Big zoon in. It is Easy to operate and share your pic. Low battery use. I don't have more word to explain. It is perfect.
