        Awesome little point and shoot., December 12, 2008
        ByB. Cox  - See all my reviews
While looking for a replacement for my broken Canon 450D (My own fault: I lived on the beach for 8 weeks and didn't protect it well enough), I came across the entry for the Powershot SD1100IS, and was immediately interested. It cost about my price range, came with everything I was used to, and had some pretty good reviews. So far, it has been a great deal. I get great photographs with really good resolution. You have to be very careful about not bumping the lens, as sometimes it will get stuck in a focus loop and you'll have to restart the camera, but that seems pretty standard for a semi-delicate piece of equipment. I am completely satisfied with my new little point-and-shoot!
