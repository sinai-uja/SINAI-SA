        Great features for a small price!, October 26, 2007

People within the photographic may poo-poo on Pentax in favor of other camera companies like Canon or Nikon, but looking at the list of features available for the Pentax, combined with weather-proofing, a long list of compatible lenses, and a great price makes the decision easy.There are, of course, downfalls to using a Pentax. Their optics aren't exactly legendary, but for an entry-level DSLR, it's quite difficult to beat a camera like this one. I've had mine for about six weeks and am pleased with my purchase.If you're a no-nonsense amateur photographer who's owned digicams and you're looking to get into the world of DSLRs, it's hard to beat everything offered by the K10D.
