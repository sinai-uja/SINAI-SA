        Bynot happy "david" (artesia, california usa)  - See all my reviews
i love this camera  great resulation,,      great features..   only draw back i have noticed is you need a large card to store anything i have 2 gig    the one that comes with the camera holds like 7 pix at full resuliton..    2nd    digital zoom is pixelated   but over all a great camera for pics and video...
