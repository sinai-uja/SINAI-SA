I have owned a 35mm Canon Rebel for the past 7 years - it takes fantastic photos so I just can't bring myself to part with it.  I bought this camera because it is small and can stay in my purse for those unexpected photo opportunities.  It has many of the same features (and then some) as my Rebel.  It it well priced compared to other camera brands that offer less.  I am very glad I stuck with Canon!
