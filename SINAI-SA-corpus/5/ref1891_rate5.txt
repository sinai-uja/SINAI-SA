        A Big Step Up to dSLR, August 5, 2008
        ByBass Cadet (California)  - See all my reviews
I recently upgraded from a P in-camera shake reduction; wireless flash capability; SD card; AA battery power; weather sealing; dust removal; pixel mapping; RAW+JPEG. On the negative side: it's missing live-view, a video mode, and is limited in number of continuous shots. * K mount and in-camera shake reduction: these were the main reason why I decided to go with Pentax. I was looking for a deal on an XSi when this showed up. After some additional research, I decided to abandon the Canon and go with Pentax. My first (non-kit) lens was a 50mm f1.7 manual lens. It's near perfect for  $40. I've also learned that Pentax's shake reduction works in three dimensions: horizontal, vertical, and rotational. Other systems lack the rotational dimension. * Wireless flash: sort of lucked into this one. I bought the AF360FGZ to go along with the K200D and found out that it supports wireless operation with the AF360FGZ. This feature almost covers the cost of the flash. Me likey! * SD card: I have a bunch of SD cards and prefer it to other formats. I do need to buy faster and higher capacity cards, though. * AA power: Sanyo Eneloop. Enough said. * Weather sealing: not essential for me but nice to have. * Dust removal/pixel mapping: good additions but haven't used yet. * RAW+JPEG: takes a lot of memory and is slow but I have mine set to  record both for now. The JPEG resolution can be set to low for quick emails/copies.As far as the drawbacks, the live-view and video mode were convenient but I've gotten used to the view-finder and also bought a new camcorder, too.For me, the most important part of a dSLR camera system is the lens. So even though this is considered an entry level dSLR, it has enough features and capabilities that'll last me a long time. I am getting lens-buying addiction (LBA), though.
