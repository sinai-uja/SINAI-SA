As far as I'm concerned, this is the optimal camera. It has all the features I've come to rely on with a point and shoot (video, image stabilization, autofocus, even 3x zoom) but also is waterproof and shockproof! I had no worries letting my 5 year old cousin use it unsupervised, there wasn't much she could do to it except maybe lose it. My favorite feature is the "rapid fire" mode, were I can take several pictures a second when trying to capture just the right frame. The only thing I miss is having a view finder. But actually so far I haven't been in a situation when the LED screen hasn't been sufficent to take a shot. Its just when I hand it to someone unfamiliar with digital cameras that it ever was an issue.
