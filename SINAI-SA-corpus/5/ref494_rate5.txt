        10,000th Picture, October 4, 2008
        ByA. Weinert  - See all my reviews
I just took my 10,000th image with this camera. I bought it 2 years ago, and it is still working great, even with the beating I have put on it. It has been rock climbing, caving, kayaking, dropped on concrete, etc. It is only now succumbing to cave dust after about 30 different caves [that destroyed my solid state flash after about 10 caves], but it still takes great pictures for now. I love having the manual mode, where I have almost limitless options for the more difficult shots. The noise at high ISO is annoying, but it seems on par for its generation. This is the camera line I buy when I want an DSLR but can only afford a 200-300 dollar camera.
