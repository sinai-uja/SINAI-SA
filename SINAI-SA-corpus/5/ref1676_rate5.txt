We went to BurningMan this summer and the dust destroyed my Minolta digital camera.  I searched for something dust proof, water proof, shock proof and the Olympus was the answer.  After it arrived it took very few minutes to read instructions and began taking excellent pictures.  I look forward to another week on the Playa with a camera that will take the abuse.
