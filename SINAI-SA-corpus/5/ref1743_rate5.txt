I own this camera for about 1 year. Friend of mine got another. Camera is rock solid but very balanced FEELS as photography tool should. There is nothing cheap or fake about the feel, the box feels all business. This camera never failed, would it be Caribbean dusty beach or freezing chill of Wisconsin. The viewfinder is nice and bright, all controls are so logically placed, all controls are tunable in menu. The image quality is plain terrific! I simply can't describe as it records all this half-toning, endless beautiful variations of the colors... The idea the ISO today is virtual variable and can dance along with aperture and shutter is of genius! I took so many natural light photos with this camera as with no other camera ever.I really appreciate Pentax did not go Canon's way of creating over-saturated and over-sharpened images. The tonal variation are very rich and smooth. This camera is everything most of photographers would need. I printed many 13x19 and they are stunning!It is rare these days to find a camera you can enjoy photography with (not fire gun 'style' shooting in all directions). This camera is an awesome tool that will contribute to LooOOoong hours of enjoying photography.
