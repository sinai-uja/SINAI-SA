        Great Camera, February 9, 2008
        ByJames Mcdonough  - See all my reviews
I've had this camera for about 3 yrs now, and it's never given me a single problem.  It takes very good pictures of scenery, but I don't think the night vision mode is particularly great (are any cameras that good @ taking shots in the dark though?).  I've never regretted purchasing this camera.
