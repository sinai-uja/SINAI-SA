I got this on sale for $149.99 and am very pleased. You can tell that some of the build isn't as solid as past models but I paid twice as much for those models. By far the best feature of this camera is that when you take a vertical picture and then import it into your computer it automatically rotates it for you. I used to spend a good 10-20 minutes after each import righting the pictures. I no longer need to do that.
