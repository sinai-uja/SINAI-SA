        What a great camera!, January 17, 2006
        A Kid's Review
I recieved this camera for my birthday and know that I made the right choice! It is so powerful and very simply laid out. I also really love its incredibly far zoom (50x).The Kodak Z750 includes many shooting modes that are wonderful because they always suit your location. The only conflict that I have with this camera, is that the batteries run out quickly. But with rechargable batteries, you will do just fine.
