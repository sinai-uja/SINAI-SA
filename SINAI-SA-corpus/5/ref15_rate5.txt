        Great upgrade for beginner!, June 2, 2008
        ByS. Scott  - See all my reviews
I replaced a very worn out camera that was slow, splotchy, and used to be fairly high end.  The PowerShot takes beautiful pictures.  I highly recommend reading the manual before trying to use it.  There are a ton of features, but specifically a few that are good for point-and-shoot users like myself (including automatic, kids and pets, night-time, etc).  It's not super fast to take the picture and reload, but I understand that is a limitation of a camera powered by AA batteries.  The viewscreen on the back is wonderful.  I particularly like that the picture is high enough quality to be able to edit to a close-up and still print a pretty large, but still high quality image.  Paired with a good photo-editing software, this is a terrific upgrade for us!  My whole family uses PowerShots and love them.  We tried a different model and it continues to impress.ps.  I haven't tried the video option...it's not what I bought the camera for.
