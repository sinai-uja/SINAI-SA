        Great little camera!, May 9, 2008

After considering the Olympus Stylus 830 and a Sony, I went with the Canon A590IS for two reasons: 1)it has a viewfinder and 2)it takes AA batteries.  The viewfinder is particularly useful to me as I bought the camera specifically to take photos of cactus blossoms in full sun.  I am still new to this camera but without having studied too much, I've gotten some excellent photos.  This 8 MP camera produces images comparable to my friend's 8 MP SLR, a much bulkier body.  Even with four sets of extra batteries, the booklet and a charger, my camera bag is smaller and has some room to spare.
