        Best amp;quot;bang for the buckamp;quot; Camera!, July 7, 2004
        ByTimothy F. O'Leary (Boston, MA)  - See all my reviews
I am absolutely delighted with the Kodak CX7430 and wholeheartedly recommend it. Kodak has cornered the market in offering tremendous features for extremely reasonable prices. I upgraded to the CX7430 from the CX7000 because I was so happy with the Kodak line. The CX7430 offers great features, such as both optical and digital zoom, and video capacity with sound, along with an outstanding 4 MPs. The operating system is the simplest and easiest to learn and use of any brand of digital camera. The entire Kodak Easy Share system makes downloading, editing, printing, and e-mailing pictures  a breeze. This is THE 4 MP camera to buy!
