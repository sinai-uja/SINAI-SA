        More than what a DSLR photographer could hope ask for, August 1, 2007

I have owned the K10D for more than 6 mos.  I am extremely pleased with its performance.  I seriously looked at the D80 but decided on the K10D because of the image stabalization and the auto dust cleaning feature.  However, changeing lenses is a pain, especially in the heat of the battle,if you know what I mean.  I elected to put a Tamron 18-200mm on my camera and I am glad I did.  (Pentax should take note  of this).  Changing lenses in the battle when time is of the essence, is unaccpectable.   There simply is not enough time to change the lens and properly put it away.  Too much fumbling, unless you have 3 hands.I am extremely pleased with this camera.  It performance is great and I am an old SLR photo.  Pentax needs to get up to speed on the lenses it will offer for this camera.  They could bust the market wide open with some wise marketing and new DA lenses which offer versility and convenience, especially in the lense changing process.  It is not like when we carried a camera bag with several lenses and a couple of bodies.That routine just does not cut it any more.  All in all, I highly recommend this camera, but suggest you spend the time to "really" learn it.  The further I go with this camera, the more I learn and the more satisified I am that I purchase it.
