        ByI. Frias (San Antonio, TX)  - See all my reviews
I am extremely happy with the purchase of my A630! i bought it about 5 months ago after doing tons of research. i didn't have any particular price range but wanted to stay under $400 for my first digital camera. for a while i couldnt decide between this model, the Canon A640 or a similar Nikon model. I decided the A640 was probably too much for me pixel wise, didn't need 10 MP. I thought the A640 was nicer looking than the A630 with it's black finish but all in all not the best value for me. the Nikon model had a stabilizer and the A630 didn't however the A630 made up for it with all the features it has. Again, this is my first digital camera so it has been a little tricky learning how all the features work but it's definitely fun to figure it out. The manuals it comes with are pretty much no help at all (thanks canon!). The battery life is actually better than i thought. It came with a 16MB memory card so i had to upgrade that. i dont have any problem transferring the pictures to my computer.the body is nice and easy to hold for any size hand. I picked a great camera for the money i paid ($257 on amazon) and its fun to use and to experiment with all the features and shooting modes.
