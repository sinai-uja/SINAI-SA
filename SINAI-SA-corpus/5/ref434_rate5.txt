        LOVE this camera!, March 4, 2008

I can't really say enough about this camera.  Although not a professional by any means, I do know my way around a camera, and other than fancy lenses there's not much more you could possibly need or want.  My favorite functions are the Macro setting and the Aperture-priority.  I like that shallow depth-of-field look with the background all fuzzed out, and this camera has a minimum aperture of 2.8, which is wonderful for achieving that look.  The camera is also small and easy to carry around in a purse.  Also?  I LOVE that it takes regular AA batteries.  I bought some rechargables and they last forever.  I take photos almost every day and I only have to charge my batteries once every few months.  Seriously great camera and easy to use.  It's probably more camera than a beginner would want (or someone completely not interested in photography), but if you're looking for a really nice camera and don't have the money for a DSLR this is a GREAT camera for you.
