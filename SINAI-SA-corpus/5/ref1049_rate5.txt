        Perfect Pocket Camera, December 12, 2008
        BySamantha Testman (NJ)  - See all my reviews
I got this to always be able to have a camera around to get shots and it slips easily into my purse or coat pocket so I do not have to miss a special shot.The pictures come out great and I have some photos that I would otherwise have missed.Great to have.
