This camera does alot.  Movies, close-ups (macros), 4x optical zoom, optical image stabilizer.  I am still learning all of the features of this product.  The easy-to-use dial control allows you to choose what kind of picture you want to take (night, night portrait, day portrait, landscape, fireworks, and others).  The price was great for a name brand digital camera.  I would recommend this product.
