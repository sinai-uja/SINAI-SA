        Very expandable!, January 20, 2008

I bought this camera in May, it's my first "real" camera.  A few things I haven't seen mentioned: you can use at least a 4GB card, that was the largest when I bought the camera and it's working fine; there are add-on lenses, I just bought a wide angle and 2X telephoto, and I see there is also a 3X.  There's another lens you can buy for closeups.  All you need is the adaptor, you can also use filters and an external flash.This is a very versatile but easy-to-use camera.  I've talked to Canon Customer Support once (when I upgraded the memory card) and they were great, but have yet to read the manual.  There are all kinds of manual settings to play with, there is also a DVD tutorial available through Amazon that I'm thinking about.  Mostly I use automatic or portrait (blurs the background).  There's a Canon Yahoo group as well.Get a tripod if you are shooting in low light, those are the ones that come out blurry for me.  Video is sharp, but you can see how much I move ;-)  Someone earlier wanted a sports setting, try Kids&Pets.This is a great camera, the swivel screen is very cool and you'll be amazed at the shots you can get.  The more you learn, the more you can do.
