        ByRick Lane "Rico" (Penn. USA)  - See all my reviews
 I bought this camera for my wife to take pictures at our 50th wedding anniverary party. So, need I say more that we are from the old school! We are both almost illiterate of modern day electronics. She wanted a camera that was easy to use but still produced good clear photos. The reason that I picked the SD1100IS Canon powershot was because of the many positive reviews and also the great low price. Well, I made the right decision, we both love the camera and the clarity of the photos. I would recommend this camera to everyone and most of all, senior citizens.
