The Canon PowerShot SD1100IS is the best point and shoot digital camera I have ever owned!  It is also the smallest compact camera I have ever had and I have really enjoyed this product.  I bought my daughter one in blue after her camera got broken and I saw what pics it was capable of taking and decided to sell the digital camera I had and replace it with a pink one of the SD1100.  I love this camera and for anyone that takes alot of pics it is the ideal camera.
