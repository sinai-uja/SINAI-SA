        Super Camera - Great Price, June 2, 2008
        ByLT4CE (Western IL)  - See all my reviews
I have had this camera a little less than a month and have already taken 1200 pictures on it!  1089 of these were on on a trip to Alaska, while the rest were "practice" shots to become familiar with the camera.  I am very impressed with the results as the beauty of our trip comes through perfectly in the photos.I bought this camera as a backup to my aging Canon S2IS with its 12X zoom, just in case it decided to quit during the trip.  The S2 survived and was used almost as much as the 590 - just the opposite of what I expected.  The size and convenience of the larger LCD screen on the 590 quickly made it a favorite of mine, and my wife's.  Because the Canon controls were very similar on both cameras, it was easy to learn, and switch between cameras.  The newer Zoom Browser software is better than the S2's, but similar and was easy to learn.I have not figured out how to disable the flash on the Auto setting, other than after I turn the camera on.  The camera takes great shots inside with some light, and the flash washes some of these out, if used.  I feel the default setting should be "Off" for the flash, even in the Auto setting, but can understand why it is "On".  I just have to remember to turn the flash off whenever I turn the 590 on.The only complaint I had of the 590 was the slowness of taking a picture.  However, I discovered in my haste to get a new memory card before the trip, I had picked up an SD card, rather than an SDHC card.  I feel the new SDHC card I ordered will solve that problem.I used the Landscape setting for many shots of Mt. McKinley, Denali, glaciers, and others with great results.Thanks to Amazon and the reviews submitted by other 590 owners, I am really enjoying this PowerShot and the unbelievable beauty of Alaska that it captured!
