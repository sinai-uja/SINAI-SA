        Camera review for A590IS, February 4, 2009
        ByColeman Pettit (Las Vegas, Nv. United States)  - See all my reviews
When i received the camera i was suprised by the small size, but it is a really nice and easy to use camera (if you read the book). the display is bright and clear and is plenty big to see your pictures so you can edit them. I am not a professional but i know what i like and i like this little camera.
