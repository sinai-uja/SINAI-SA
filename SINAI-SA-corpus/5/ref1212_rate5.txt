I had purchased the V803 back in march of 07 and was super happy with it. just the fact that it comes in purple was awesome enough for me. the actually picture taking was super clear and crispy. all the features are super easy to use. but then my friend dropped it and all the pictures that were taken after that were blurry. so i ended up needing another one. so i purchased the V1003 Which i might add is the one i originally wanted back then anyway. But i got it. and it works exactly the same, has super crispy pictures, very easy navigation. i absolutely love the camera. i even bought one for my mom for mother's day b/c she kept griping about mine, so i finally got her one. she always had crappy cameras in the past and i believed she deserved it. she's beed using it non stop and has had no bad experiences yet. i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a digital camera, its a great product and im VERY happy with it. i would just suggest not dropping it. :)
