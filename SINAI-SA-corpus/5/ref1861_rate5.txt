        K200D Amazing Camera and Value for $$$, May 8, 2008

I just got the Pentax K200D and it is amazing, my first thoughts when I was handling it were how solid the camera was! Especially compared to the Canon Digital Rebel XSi and Nikon D40! The Kit lens is also amazing, it's very sharp and has a decent manual focusing ring (Hoo-Ray!). Pentax also included a lens hood!The camera is very responsive when taking pictures as long as you give the camera a second or two after firing off four shots or so in quick succession, you will be fine shooting either JPEG or RAW.The autofocus is quick and reliable in most conditions, in low light it's a bit slower but still accurate most of the time, not as fast as Nikon or Canon's systems but darn close.Picture quality is absolutely amazing but if you want the best pictures you will undoubtedly have to use the more manual oriented modes and shoot RAW (PEF or DNG) the camera gives you several default image tones that you can customize to your liking when shooting JPEG. I'd recommend shooting in "Bright" image tone if you do not intend to post process your JPEG's, but if you do want to post process I would recommend shooting in "Natural" image tone.The auto WB can be a little off at times but the camera also has a whole bunch of white balance presets, so chances are you will find the preset to match the lighting conditions that you are shooting in and if you can't then you can use the custom WB which you can perfectly fine tune it if you want to.Battery life is also excellent, when using Energizer AA Lithium Ion batteries I got about 1,100 shots, which is what Pentax specifies the camera can do using Lithium Ion AA's. With Sanyo Eneloops Hybrid Ni-MH rechargeable batteries I was able to crank out about 850 shots which is truly amazing as well.
