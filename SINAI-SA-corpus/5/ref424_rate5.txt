This wonderful camera is like two cameras in one.  You can set it to auto and anyone can use it as a point-and-shoot model capable of some very nice shots.  If you happen to like to use manual settings and apply an artistic eye to your shots, it is very good at this as well.  I have just started trying to take more artistic shots and this camera is very good for this purpose and has many helpful features.  Tons of options, a high resolution, even a widescreen mode, in addition to the "stitch" feature (in which you take a series of photos, such as a panorama, and features on the camera along with the included software lets you stitch the photos together into one big photograph), the affordable price, semi-small size, and large number of add-ons and lenses make this a wonderful purchase!  It is also nice to have a camera that takes regular AA batteries instead of some kind of proprietary rechargable battery.  If you ever find yourself with dead batteries and no spares, you can find AA batteries in just about every amusement park, city, or country that you may find yourself in.
