I purchased this camera about 3 weeks ago, wanted a new one to take to Vegas.  I did alot of research, online and in the stores, and I mainly liked this one because of the swivel display.  I also found the best deal on Amazon, I did the uprade on shipping and got in in 3 days!! I was really surprised to get it so quickly. A major discount store had this camera for $50 higher so I decided to get it online, a no-brainer.  This phone was very easy to use out of the box and the picture quality is impressive.  I am very happy with it and my shopping experience on Amazon. I own 2 Sony digital cameras, they are ok, but I really am much happier with my new Canon.
