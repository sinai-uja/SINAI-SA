        best damn camera, October 13, 2008
        ByD. Wilk  - See all my reviews
I've had this camera for well over a year now and it just never ceases to please.  I love the standard AA batts which allow me to use the batteries of my choice and affordably keep multiple spares.  I can also pick up replacement batts just about anywhere so I never need to worry about being without my charger...Consumer reports rated it tops in picture quality and that is no lie.  I almost feel embarrassed for all the nikon coolpix owners in my family.  It's a little on the slow side, but the copious options (allowing you almost the flexibility of an SLR), flexible LCD, and overall picture quality more than make up for it.  Consumer reports has just named the PowerShot A650 to the top of the heap so I already know what I'll be getting to replace this one should I ever be forced to.Oh, it's pretty tough too.  It's been on numerous trips, hiking and otherwise, and taken a few trips to the floor... the hard way.
