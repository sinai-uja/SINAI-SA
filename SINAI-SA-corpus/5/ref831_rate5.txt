        So good, my head exploded, March 28, 2008
        ByGordon Ewasiuk (Washington, DC)  - See all my reviews
(NOTE:  I've had the camera for two days.)This camera is nothing short of amazing.  First, the size.  It literally fits in your hand!  The size means the camera can slip into a shirt pocket and go ANYWHERE.  I wear an orange safety vest at work and this camera fits neatly into a pocket.  In the two days I've had this camera, I've taken almost 150 pictures!  Entirely due to the size of the camera.  It goes everywhere with me now.  Features?  How did Canon pack so much into such a tiny package?  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.  Most people won't crack the manual until they start taking more advanced shots.  For the rookie (read: me), this camera is a true point-and-shoot.  The optical image stabilization is wonderful and works like a champ.  The 8MP pictures look HUGE.  There are two different zoom modes  on this camera.  A 3x regular zoom plus another 6-7x optical.  The battery for this camera charged in less than 90mins.   Camera came with a 32MB SD card which goes very fast at 8MP.  Still, the fact that Canon included one at all speaks volumes about the company.  Lots of accessories are available too.  There are a bunch of more advanced features that I can't speak about.  Different shooting modes, ISO settings, and other neat things.  There is even a movie mode!Images look great to this untrained eye.  Your mileage will vary.Highly recommend for people who just want to take lots and lots of pictures!
