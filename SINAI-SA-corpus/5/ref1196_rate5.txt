I have this camera and I like using it.  The controls are easy to navigate.  I disagree with the comment about it being too slow.  The camera is set to have a preview after a picture is taken.  You can change this setting to less time or press the shutter button half way down and the camera will take a picture immediately after the last.  Good value for 10mp.
