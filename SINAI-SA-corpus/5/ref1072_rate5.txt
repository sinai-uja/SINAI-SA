        BEST COMPACT CAMERA!!!, June 10, 2008
        ByAndrea Willis (Scottsdale, Arizona)  - See all my reviews
Before buying this camera, I researched all of the Canon Powershot (ultra compact) cameras on Canon's website, as well as, reading blogs and reviews elsewhere online.  This camera is fantastic for someone who wants to take a great picture ALL of the time with the image stabilization (IS) feature.  I would NOT buy any camera without the IS feature.  I bought this camera because IT HAS MOVIE WITH SOUND (SOUND IS KEY) as many other models do not have sound. I also wanted a view window (viewfinder) in case the sun was too bright in Arizona to see the images on the nice 2.5" LCD screen.  I haven't had to use the view finder yet. :-)  Now this camera isn't for zooming and taking far off shots in nature as the zoom isn't nearly strong enough for that. Things look smaller on the screen (mountains) than to the naked eye.  But if you want a great camera for taking pictures of people, pets and with the macro setting (up close such as jewelry to list on ebay) this camera will be your new best friend.  It is easy to work and the instructions are actually easy to understand.  I am so thrilled with it. THE PICTURES ARE FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!  And, with amazon, you have no sales tax ... so you will be hard pressed to find a better deal.  And, you can choose the various colors vs. just having another silver camera like everyone else.  I chose the Brown and love it.  God Bless!
