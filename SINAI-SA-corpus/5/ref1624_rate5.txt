I bought this for my daughter for her honeymoon.  Everyone looked at her like she was crazy when she took it in the pool and when she went snorkeling.  The pictures came out amazing both underwater and on land. She took a great picture of her husband above the water from under the water and the resort even shows up in the background!!  Now her friends and cousins are going to sell their cameras and buy this one.  I highly recommend this.  Make sure you read all of the directions and do your settings correctly and you will be amazed at the ease and quality.
