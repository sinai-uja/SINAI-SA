Oldie but Goodie!ProsQuality of pictures, features, easy of use, valueConsShutter lag, red eye light effective but annoying to subjectsReviewI have owned this camera for a few years and have used it in many situations sunlight, dark, motion shots. This is a super camera that allows to you to shoot in Auto mode or adjust settings as you become a better photographer. Very simple to use for a beginner and helped me worked up to a SLR with ease. Although I still use my Z740. The pictures look amazing and many people ask me what kind of camera I use and appear surprised when I tell them. Size is handy to just grab and go. Now for the not so great. I have better success when I set my own adjustments rather than using the Sports mode. The shutter can lag (expected), and bring along a spare battery if you plan to take alot of pictures.
