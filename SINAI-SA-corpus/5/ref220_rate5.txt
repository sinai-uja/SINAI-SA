This Camera is the best digital camera I have personally used.  It has so many options on how you want to take your pictures, and the 4x Optical Zoom is nice.  Pictures are crisp and clear.  I recommend it to anyone who loves to take random pictures and photoshop them :D.  Just be sure to buy a memory card with this, the one that comes with it is crap.  P.S. I recommend getting the Transcend SDHC Memory Card 4GB, good memory for cheap!
