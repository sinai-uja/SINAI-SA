        Very Happy with the camera, December 12, 2008

We are very happy with this purchase so far. Camera is easy to use and we find the manuals very user friendly. We especially like the viewfinder. After borrowing our son's pocket camera for a recent vacation, we knew we needed a viewfinder. His did not have one and on sunny days it was very difficult to tell what you were taking a photo of. Although you don't often need the viewfinder, it is definitely a plus in our mind. We also like that it has the rechargable battery. We bought an extra battery so we will not be caught without a charged battery. Although some like regular batteries, I feel it is too much waste and too many batteries being tossed in landfills. We feel we made a good choice with this camera. It has lots of features and is easy to use.
