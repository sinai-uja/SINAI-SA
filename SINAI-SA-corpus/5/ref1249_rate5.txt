Kodak EasyShare V1003 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Midnight Black)what a nice camera!.... you can highlite, crop and fix the photo all in the camera!...also it stores your pics when your memory card runs out....the lcd screen is large and clear and you can see the screen even in the bright sun!....i highly recommend this product!
