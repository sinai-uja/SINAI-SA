        Canon A630, January 31, 2009

We owned the previous model of this camera and loved it.  This one is basically the same design with a few improvements on the casing.   My absolute favorite - and MUST have - feature is the flip out and rotate display screen.  We use the self portrait feature a lot so that is ultimately important to us.
