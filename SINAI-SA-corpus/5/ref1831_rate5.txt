Not much to add to everything that's been said already; killer DSLR with excellent features and image quality. In capable hands it will produce output as good as anything else in its class and at the same time, like the rest of the Pentax lineup, offers stunning value and some unique features. You can tell it's been designed by photographers, for photographers.
