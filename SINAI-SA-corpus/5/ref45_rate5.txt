I recently bought this camera to replace a Samsung model I had. I have to say that so far I have been impressed. This Canon is easy to use, has a much fast reaction time between shots, and great picture quality. I've used the video function on it, and my husband asked if I had use our video camera! I don't know why people think it's so loud...I just turned off the volume, and therefor makes no noise. I love that it is easy turn the flash on and off. This little camera, is easily worth the money, and what's not to love when it performs well, and comes with such a sweet price tag?
