        Review after a month of use..., July 20, 2008
        ByL. Shaw (United States)  - See all my reviews
Have been experimenting with the camera since getting it back in early June.  I did LOTS of research, wanting to get the most for my $$ in the "prosumer" range.  Sure, it would be great to spend mucho $$ on a Nikon D300 but I have to put gas in the car too.I would say that the positive reviews others have posted are accurate.  The camera quality is excellent - its hard to put into words what it feels like, but it does feel more solid and well put together than others.  The kit lens is surprisingly good as well.  Very sharp and quick. I looked at others in this price range and while the Sony A300 had a cool LiveView feature, it felt "plasticky" and the reviews for the kit lens were usually horrible.  After going to a Circuit City and playing with the Sony for awhile, I had doubts as to its potential longevity.  The Canon's, Nikon's and Olympus' in this genre all cost more and were missing one or more key features.Definitely put this camera/lens combo on your short list.  Great build quality, nice lens for a great package price, plenty of accessories, compatibility with a ton of older lenses, wireless flash sync, shake reduction in body, weather resistant.  Done!  Now I'm thinking about a nice complimentary lens to go with the kit.  55-300 is looking nice...
