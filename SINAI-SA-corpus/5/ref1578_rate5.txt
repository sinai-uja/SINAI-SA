        Great camera!, October 24, 2008

This is a great camera for underwater and travel. It is very easy to use, it takes good pictures and it truly is waterproof, drop-proof, crush-proof and so much more! The only issue I had with it was drying the lens off after taking it out of the water when I wanted to take an above water picture. Otherwise, I love it! It certainly serves its purpose.
