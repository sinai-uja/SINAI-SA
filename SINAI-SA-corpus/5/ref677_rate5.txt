        So far, SO good --, February 10, 2007

I've been using this camera for a couple months and am very happy with it.  The big flip screen is a great asset - and my pictures are excellent quality, although I haven't yet read the manual.  No doubt they'll be spectacular once I do that.  Previously I had a sophisticated "professional" Olympus digital with too many options for me, so I gave it to our son, who has more patience and understanding. This one may have the same options, but somehow it isn't as daunting.
