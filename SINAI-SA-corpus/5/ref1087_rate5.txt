        Excellent for a point-and-shoot, and now an excellent value, September 13, 2008

Now that Canon and its rivals are offering numerous compact and ultracompact point-and-shoot cameras in the 10-12 megapixel range, the price on this 8 megapixel unit has dropped dramatically. But don't be fooled by the notion that more megapixels is better -- in this class of camera, it's not necessarily true. Unless the sensor is larger, which it generally isn't, you will often not see any difference in the 10 and 12 MP cameras. In fact, you might get more noise. You are also likely to get a longer delay between shots. So if you are buying a high end digital SLR, sure, go for 12, 14, or now even 16 megapixels. But for a point-and-shoot compact, 7 or 8 MP is more than adequate.This model offers 8 MP, face detection, and a variety of shooting modes that can be easily selected from a menu. It provides excellent results for everyday photography. It is also extremely compact and easily fits in a pocket or purse. If you want a camera to take along wherever you go, this is a must-have. It's also an incredible value, now available for as little as $160-$180.If you buy this camera, note that it only includes a 32 MB memory card, which holds roughly 10-12 photos. You will certainly want to purchase a good, fast card. The SanDisk Extreme 4 GB works great and will hold over 1000 photos at the highest resolution (1800-2500 at lower image settings). You can now get one for $30-$45.  Also, you may want to get an extra battery. Lenmar makes a good Canon equivalent that you can get for about $10. (Beware of no-name knockoffs that cost $2 or $3!)Overall, excellent ultracompact point-and-shoot camera. Get this item to have with you all the time. (And save up $1000-$3000+ for a high-end digital SLR if you have serious, semi-pro photography needs).
