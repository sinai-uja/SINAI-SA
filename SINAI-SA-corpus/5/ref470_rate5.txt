Gotta love it - easy to use, simple instructions make even the most complicated setting a breeze.  Love the pivoting viewer - makes lining up the group shot easier and never a worry about scratching or cracking it.  Wish it was smaller but then again the size is due to the batteries (AA) which last surprising long and for the forgetful charging impaired you are never too far from somplace that sells them.  Videos are amazing - clear video and audio - sorry I didn't buy it sooner
