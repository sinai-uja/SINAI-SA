        Great camera, August 19, 2006
        ByB. Murphy (Atlanta, GA United States)  - See all my reviews
Just came back from a family outing - everyone had a different camera - each in approximately the same price range. We voted my Kodak Z740 the best of all of them.  It was the only one in that range with such a powerful zoom, and the picture quality is outstanding. I was also the only one who could see the display in extremely bright sunlight.  I highly recommend this camera.  It is ever-so-slightly bulky compared to some of the others, but it's worth it for the picture quality. I agree with the reviews about the lens cap problem - it just doesn't stay on very well.  But of all things that could go wrong with a camera, it's a minor inconvenience.  We decided that some of the pictures taken that day could be used by Kodak as advertisement pics....they were so clear they almost looked fake.
