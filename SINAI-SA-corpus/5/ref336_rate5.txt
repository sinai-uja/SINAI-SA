- Easy to use even if this is your first digital camera- Produces good results- Manual and automatic modes- Great value for its price- Small size, light and easy to carry- Uses AA batteries that are available everywhere- Takes short movie clips also- It does not come with a case so I bought Canon PSC-85 Deluxe Soft Case for Canon Powershot A650IS and A720IS - Also bought a Sandisk 2GB SD card
