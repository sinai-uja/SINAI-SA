        Very Good Value for Money, May 23, 2005
        Bylaksh (India)  - See all my reviews
Just got this camera a couple of days ago.photo quality is very good though i would let the camera take a few days time as all the electronics has to break in well and running smoothly,ex-audio systems TV's etc etc,so also cameras.the main thing is the ease of Use and it is so simple to use i just had to refer to the manual twice for a few clarifications,the close mode is good and the kodak lens is as good as any other camera in the market infact slightly better ,as it is showing details which i never saw before in pictures.and amazon customer service is top notch ,got a good new camera at a good price.Be sure to check yur firmware version in the about section it should read 1.01 mine was 1.00 and kodak had the firmware on their site in the CX 7430 support section  ,just log in with a email ID and download the firmware and upgrade all instructions are in perfect clarity.overall kodak is very good and would only buy kodak from now mainly for the color quality
