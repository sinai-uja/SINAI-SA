This is the best Canon point and shoot that I have purchased yet!I had the A75, A520 and then this one.  People are always looking at my pictures and ask "What kind of camera do you have?".  They think it is some pro model.  The picture quality is great and the features available make it very versitile.  Video is also very good. The battery life is very long with high quality rechargables too.  On a recent Grand Canyon trip I took over 600 pictures in 13 days on one set of batteries.  Amazing!Great camera, no doubt!
