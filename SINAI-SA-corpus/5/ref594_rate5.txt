I've been very happy with Canons in general - this is no exception.  This is the first digital camera I've had that doesn't suffer from a noticeable delay when shooting.  The only exception is when flash is required, but that's typical of all point-and-shoots.  I especially like the fact that this camera uses standard batteries.  I'm using a decent set of rechargables and battery life has been quite good.
