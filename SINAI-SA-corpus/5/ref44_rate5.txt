This camera was everything that I expected. With the 8 gigs of memory we will never fill it up. We haven't tried the video as of yet. It the card will hold about 1 1/2 hours of video. We will not use all of the 8MP. It is not necessary to get the quality of pictures that we desire. The only time we might set it up high is to take pictures at a distance and then crop them down. It is well worth the money we paid for it. $104
