        Solid All Purpose Camera, January 9, 2007
        ByTodd (Virginia)  - See all my reviews
Canon's product quality and customer service led me to buy the camera and it has not disappointed.  It has all the picture quality and features I could need for everyday use.  I find I use the video feature of the camera as much as taking still pictures.  It's easy to bounce back and forth and the camera lets you easily adjust resolution for e-mailing video clips and pictures to friends and family.
