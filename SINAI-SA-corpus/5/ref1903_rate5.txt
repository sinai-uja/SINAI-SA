        Pentax k200d, August 27, 2008
        ByP. Quinn  - See all my reviews
I have used the camera for about a month now (1500 pictures) and I am in love with it. Paired with the Pentax 18-250mm zoom lens it has been a joy to use. With its incamera stablization, I have been able to capture great shots from Macro to the full extention of the zoom. The greatest benefit for me has been its ability to capture pictures that require no adjustments at all other than the occasional crops. I highly recommend both the camera and the 18-250 lens.
