        GREAT CAMERA! , July 10, 2008
        ByC. Schubert  - See all my reviews
I just got this camera for my birthday and i been looking at the reviews on amazon saying that this camera takes bad pictures. HELL NO IT DOESNT! It is probably the easiest camera to use. I think the problem with people getting bad shots is that they dont know how to use a camera in general. I mean the settings are right there for you to use. Honestly if you cant choose the pre settings that are available then just switch it to auto. lol I dont know what other people are talking about with the battery. If someone is saying something negative about it then they just got a bad one. Hey, it happens. When I got my camera, I put the battery in right away and used it for 15 min. After 15 min it said it was gonna die. I recharged it for 3 hours. The next day I took it to the water park for 6 hours. And during the six hours it was probably turned on for 5 because i hardly turned it off. I was taking so many pictures! Also if you need to know, the camera was in the water pretty much the entire time possible. Gave me no problems. So after 5 hours of it being on, I checked the battery life on the screen. GUESS WHAT!?!?! Still FULLY CHARGED!!! Taking video.. On VGA mode yes only ten seconds. But on QVGA at 30fps IT LOOKED GREAT!! and it records as long as you have space on your memory card. Sound could be a little better but its a camera for a reason. to take pictures.Great camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to get their moneys worth.
