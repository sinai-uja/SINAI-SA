        Worth the $, April 4, 2003
        ByLisa G. Leitz (Washington State)  - See all my reviews
This little camera was one of the best investments I made for my business (I publish a small newspaper in rural WA). I wanted something I could carry in my purse, since I like to have a camera with me at all times. It's lightweight, easy to handle (I have been able to take pictures while hanging onto my notebook, a pen, and a plate of food) and isn't so obtrusive that people think "oh, so the press is here" the moment I walk in the room. The high res is great--nobody believes me when I tell them we use a digital camera, and we enlarge a lot of shots. The 8x zoom allows me to be part of the crowd--I can hang back and don't have to get in someone's face to get decent shots. I've also found it useful for wildlife photography for the same reason.Complaints? Yeah, the card is too small, you'll need another battery, and you'll probably need to read the manual, and refer to it often, especially if you use a bigger speedlight or wide angle lens. Another reviewer says the small LCD display is too small--but I use mine all the time. The compactness of the unit probably dictated that the screen be on the small side--a worthwhile sacrifice, in my opinion. Being able to see what shots I've got has saved me a lot of time, and you can also use the screen as a viewfinder if you can't have the camera right next to your face.For my needs, it's been a perfect match and I've been quite impressed with it.
