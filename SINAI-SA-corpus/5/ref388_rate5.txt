        ByGregory C. Snyder (Austin, TX USA)  - See all my reviews
I have owned 3 digital cameras before buying the Canon PowerShot A590IS. This is hands down the best camera I have ever owned and I have owned 35mm SLR cameras as well. The ease of use, the controls, the features, even the software that came with this camera makes it the best I have ever owned. The picture quality is phenomenal, even when shooting moving people indoors with flash. I take this camera with me everywhere and have taken over 450 pictures within the first 10 days that I have owned it. I am very pleased and would highly recommend this camera.
