This camera was everything I expected and more. Very user friendly. I had been using film until now and I am not disappointed. The quality of the photos with 8 megapixels are great. So many good points and options there are too many to list. I did my homework, and this is the best small digital camera for the price range. I put a 4 G flash card in it and I am very happy.
