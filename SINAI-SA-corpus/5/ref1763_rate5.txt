I've waited a long time for this camera.  Have several Pentax film camera's, but the prwvious batch of DSLR couldn't compete against film.  Glad they have finally reached 10 megs.  Haven't used all menu options yet. Too many?  We'll see.Only negative to date, Camera heavier then fil cameras.  This was Pentax claim to fame over the other major brands- lightness.
