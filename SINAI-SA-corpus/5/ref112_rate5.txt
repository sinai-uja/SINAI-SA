        Great point and shoot, April 11, 2008
        ByPeter D. ONeill "Pete O." (USA)  - See all my reviews
I bought the A590 as our first digital camera.  We just came back from a trip to England where we took more than 300 pictures.  We haven't printed them yet, but they look great on our computer.  We even took some action shots during a soccer/football match, and most of those look great also.  We took all our shots in the auto mode.  When we were considering buying this camera, it was a bit confusing to read all the reviews about the more exotic features of this camera.  I suppose it's nice to have all those features available on this camera, but I'm not sure those features are relevant to someone like me who is simply looking for a good "point and shoot" camera.  I'm glad I bought the A590, and would recommend it to my friends.
