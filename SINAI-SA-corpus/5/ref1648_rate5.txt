        Great camera, May 30, 2008
        ByD. Henderson (Hartford, CT)  - See all my reviews
This is my third Olympus camera and I love the flexibility of not worrying about water. I broke one camera when I accidentally sat on in with the lens open. Since this one is completely contained, there is no risk.If you want a camera that you can take to the beach, on a kayak trip, skiing, etc. This is the one for you. I will be trying it on a scuba trip later this summer.The photos I am getting are really clear. I had a 7 Mega pixel camera before, but I can crop farther with this one.The digital zoom seems to work OK, but it limits the resolution of the photos.I have been using this camera for a month now and still have not had to recharge the battery, so I guess battery life is going to be good.
