        Best Little Camera I've ever owned, January 6, 2009

The Canon SD1100IS is small enough to take everywhere every time. It is capable enough that I sometimes choose to take it where I know I'll be taking pictures; situations where I normally would lug along my super-zoom.Excellent battery life, very quick response, great flexibility.Exceptional macro capability and well placed controls.It puzzles me that marketing makes a big deal of its colors; this is a quality tool at a good price. Not just a toy.I also have fun with the built-in stop-motion video modes.The only minor difficulty is getting used to using such a small camera with my big fingers. There is a reason that the manual repeatedly warns one to wear the wrist strap.
