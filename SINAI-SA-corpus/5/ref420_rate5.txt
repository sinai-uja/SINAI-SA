        great camera, great price, April 25, 2007
        BySue Autumn (Brooklyn, NY USA)  - See all my reviews
I just have the camera a few weeks, but I am extremely happy with its efficiency, clarity and wonderful features. (I did expect it to be a little more compact, but that's really my fault- I should've checked the measurements in advance). One disappointment I had has nothing to do with the camera itself but with the fact that I ordered the canon camera case PSC-65 on this website since it stated that it's compatible with the A630, but I was very upset to find that the case was way too small, and I had to return it. Oh well. But the camera is great!
