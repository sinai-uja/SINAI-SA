        Amazing Camera, December 11, 2007
        ByShawnT (Duluth, MN)  - See all my reviews
I purchased the K10d as an upgrade from my 8ist DL. I have to say that this camera impresses me everytime I take it out shooting. I went shooting in -13 degree Farenheit weather for four hours and only drained 1/4 of the batter power. After getting it home and letting it warm up the battery registered full. Also, it seems to do a better job of metering than the *ist DL. My images are more vivid, sharper and I find myself not doing much to my RAW images.the shake reduction works great. I recently shot at 1/2 second and got a sharp image. This is not likely to happen all the time, but still, impressive. The camera's Noise reduction feature works awesome. It makes taking star trails a breeze, no hot pixels and no noise. So far i can't find a thing i don't like about this camera other than i didn't buy it sooner.
