        Gift for my wife, January 8, 2009
        ByStuart J. Joseph (Rockaway, NJ)  - See all my reviews
This my wife's first digital camera.  For someone who tends to avoid new technology, she really likes it.  She likes that it has a view finder because she is not comfortable holding it away from her face and just looking at the lcd screen.  She also likes that it uses AA batteries so that she can bring extras whith her instead of having to plug the camera into a charger.  She has only used it indoors so far, but the photos are very clear and the lighting is perfect.  Her old camera was fine outside in natural light, but the indoor photos were poor.  That makes this camera a hit for her.  She needed a little help figuing out the timer, but since we have teens in the house, they showed her what to do.  I really like that it uses SD cards because they are much less expensive than the Memory Sticks used by the Sony.  If you leave the camera set for max resultion (8MP) the memory cards can fill up quicker than you think.
