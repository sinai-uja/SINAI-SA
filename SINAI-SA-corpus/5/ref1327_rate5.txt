Quality camera, takes awesome photos, movie recording very clear and bright.  The camera is easy to use and compact. The settings are simple by the use of icons on the dial. Printing and enlarging photos are crisp and clear. I would suggest using a larger storage disk, i.e. 3 GB.  Highly recommend this camera.
