        A590IS, October 14, 2008
        ByJohn P. Keels (Boone, NC, USA)  - See all my reviews
I have had both the A570is and the A590is. They are nearly identical. I do like the video modes on the A570is and it is curious that Canon reduced the quality and FPS rating on the video. Other than that, they are both superb cameras for the money. As for the flash issue that people keep reporting about. I don't understand how people expect normal cheap alkalines to be adequate. If you want the batteries to last anytime at all and have a reasonable flash recharge you have to have HIGH capacity rechargeable NiMH batteries in the range of 2400mah. If you do that you will find this camera a pleasure. If you try to cheap out and get by on the crummy alkalines from the drugstore this camera is going to be MISERABLE.Please do yourself a favor and spend about $20 on a nice set of decent high capacity rechargables and a charger and its advisable to have at least four batteries that way you have an extra set of rechargables in your camera bag at all times. I did this on a trip to India with the A570 and with those high capacity batteries and the extra set on hand I never had problems with flash recharge time.Otherwise, this is an excellent camera. It takes nice, clean pictures most of the time. Of course, it is not up to DSLR levels but I dont' expect that. At this price though it really is a superb camera. I like mine alot.
