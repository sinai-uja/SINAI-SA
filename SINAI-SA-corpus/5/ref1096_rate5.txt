I need a camera for everything, business and pleasure. And, this is an ideal camera. I had the predecessor and will continuepurhasing cannon powershot cameras. Clear photos, great size cameara fits in the pocket or purse. Can't go wrong with this one. Purchase a memory card that holds dozens of pix, though.
