I researched for a very long time before deciding on the Z740.  I am sooooo HAPPY with my purchase.  Kodak's cameras are so easy to use and this one is no exception!  The pictures I have taken are AWESOME!  I love having the 10X zoom, I can get some amazing closeups.  I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for  an easy to use camera that has the capability to do a lot with!
