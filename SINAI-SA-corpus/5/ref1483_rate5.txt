        An Amazing Little Camera, December 15, 2002

Today is my 15th day of Nikon Coolpix 5700 ownership.  Let me put to rest the "too long to focus under low light" rap--I just shot a beautiful photo of the not-yet-full moon, and I can count the mountains and craters.  Considering the fact that I bought this camera primarily for macro work and web publishing, I have yet to find anything that it does not do well.     It does come with only 179 pages of instructions and it is covered with some 18 different buttons and external controls, but don't let that stop you!  You can start with it set on full Auto everything and use it like a high-end digital Brownie, or you can dig into the instructions and start to mine that Nikon pedigree.  My first shot was an Auto everything of my son, and it was stunningly gorgeous with very little help from me.  He was standing in a darkened stairwell and the 5700 saw him a lot better than I did.     Is that Nikon pedigree worth it?  Oh yeah, you bet it is.  You will find your love of photography rekindled with this camera in your hands.
