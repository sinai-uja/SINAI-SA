        Canon A630 Good Camera., January 11, 2007
        ByPenco (Michigan)  - See all my reviews
   AI've been using a Canon F1 all my life and was a little intimidated going digital. Fear not! The A630 is like carrying a bag of accessories for the F1. You should have some experience with photography to get the full benefit from the A630. If you're a complete novice you will have to learn a lot before you will be able to get the full benefit of all the camera can do. You have to understand the terminology. IN auto mode you will get nice shots while learning the rest.    I like the A630 very much.
