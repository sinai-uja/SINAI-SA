My husband & I took 6 weeks to travel to the western National Parks.  Our original camera got dropped in the sand 10 days before leaving.  A friend volunteered the Kodak Z740.  We ended up taking over 1100 pictures including numerous pics of the beautiful scenery shot from our moving car.  Much to our delight the camera performed way beyond our expectations and as soon as we returned we decided to buy one for ourselves.  It's easy to hold, simple directions, numerous options and takes a clear picture.  We downloaded pics every night to our PC and sent them to friends.  For "Joe" picture taker its a great camera.
