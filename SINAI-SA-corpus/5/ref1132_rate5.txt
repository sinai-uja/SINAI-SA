        Best Camera I've Ever Owned!, September 16, 2005

I've owned about 10 cameras in my life. My needs are pretty simple. I just want a camera that will make it easy to take a good photo. The CX7430 does just that.The digital camera I was replacing, a Powershot 200, I threw in the garbage, literally. It ate batteries, it seemed to operate randomly, and there was a long, annoying delay before it took the picture so I often "missed the moment." It also was a bit of a pain to figure out how to operate.I've had my CX7430 for about a month, and I love it. The best thing about this camera is that it is very intuitive. I've been able to figure out how to do just about everything by just looking at the camera and using common sense. So far, I haven't had to replace the batteries. It takes the photo promptly. The optical zoom is nice. The quality of the photos looks good.If you are a very serious photographer, you'll probably want a more expensive camera. If you want a simple, inexpensive, intuitive camera that will take nice photos when you want it to, this should be a good choice.
