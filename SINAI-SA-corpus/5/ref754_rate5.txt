        CANON SD1100 IS short review, February 20, 2009
        ByReginald Kenneth  Dwight  - See all my reviews
I got this camera a few days ago and it is my 2nd compact camera. It replaces my Nikon Coolpix 4300 that I had since 2003. This camera is very compact.The battery only takes 90 minutes to recharge. This camera takes excellent quality images. This camera is small enough to take to concerts which is one of the main reasons I chose this one. It has an automatic lens cover when you power the camera on or off which is a plus. (no more lens caps).Only has a few buttons on the back, but they are the ones you will use the most. It does not have many manual function settings- it is basically an automatic point and shoot. The only things you will need to complete this camera is a 4 or 8 GB SD card and a carry case.This camera is selling for $100 less from when it first went on the market a year ago.This is one of the few point and shoot cameras that still averages at least one rave review per day on amazon and one of the most reviewed cameras.(around 650 reviews as of 2-21-09). This camera is definately 5 stars!
