        Great Starter Camera for Budding Photographers!, December 28, 2008
        BySteven D. Ayers (MI,USA)  - See all my reviews
We bought this camera for our 12 year old son this year because he loves using ours and he also loves making silly videos, so we thought about getting a kids cam for him at first, but the reviews for them were horrible, so we checked all over Amazon and found this one to have the best overall rating. I have to say that everyone was right on target with this one. I'm not a camra geek or a professional photographer, but this is a really nice camera, even for an adult. It takes great pics in the dark and obviously in the light. The video quality is nice and I like that it doesn't have a "swing" out view window that could possibly be broken off. I gave this camera a 5* because it's just an awesome well made camera for just about anyone.
