I've been taking shots and learning to use the functions of this camera for over 3 weeks now.  This was a smart buy and I also purchased an additional 4 GB SD memory.  Having a good memory space was excellent amazon advise since I can do a lot of experiments to check the results on my computer screen.Everything worked perfectly.  No strange issues. This camera is excellent for people who wants to get near to professional shots without complications but remember:  Practice makes one a master.
