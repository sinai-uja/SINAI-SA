Great all-around camera for casual indoor/outdoor shots, videos, and close-ups.   I'm having a lot of fun taking it hiking and skiing.   Image stablization seems to work as the pics aren't as blurry as other cameras taking shots on the go. Definitely needed to add extra memory because it filled the tiny builtin memory taking a few dozen shots at full resolution.
