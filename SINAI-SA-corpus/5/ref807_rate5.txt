        GREAT CAMERA, November 23, 2008
        ByDon (Minnesota)  - See all my reviews
I have had several digital cameras but I have yet found a camera that is as nice as this Canon.   It is so easy to use and the pictures are fantastic.   The size is so nice and small it fits into a shirt pocket and even any small place where it is handy to reach in the car.  I have taken more pictures with this camera in a short period of time than any of the other I have owned.  Give it a try......you won't be sorry.
