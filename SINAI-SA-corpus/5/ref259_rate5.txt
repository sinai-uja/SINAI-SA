        ByDavid F. Reuter Jr. "Rudder2" (Florida)  - See all my reviews
This camera has many great features you would find on an expensive digital camera.  It functions well and withstands drops even on tile floors!  Great value I recommend it 100% to any person looking for a small camera with lots of features.
