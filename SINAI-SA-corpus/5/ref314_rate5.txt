We needed a camera after the several year old Nikon Coolpix died suddenly. Word of mouth on Canons was very good, good specs and the price is right. After using the camera for a month I have no negatives. Its very easy to use yet offers quite a bit of control over the exposure when you don't want auto exposure. Battery life is very good. This unit also has excellent macro capabilities. I like the fit and feel in the hand since I don't care for really thin and flat cameras. All in all you can't go wrong with the A590IS at the current price.
