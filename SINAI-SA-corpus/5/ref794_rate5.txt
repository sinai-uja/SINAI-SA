        Bybaybreeze "baybreeze210" (Boston, Ma)  - See all my reviews
This is an excellent compact camera that won rave reviews in Consumer Report magazine. I bought one for my son at Walmart for $199 a few months ago and he loves it, so I got another for my daughter for Christmas, but this time I used Amazon and it was $50 cheaper! Even got free shipping..great deal.
