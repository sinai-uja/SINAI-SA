        Absolutely Fabulous Camera, November 24, 2008
        ByDouglas Peterson "Jesus Is Lord of All" (McHenry, IL)  - See all my reviews
A funny thing happened on the golf course, I left my Kodak camera in a cup holder, my son-in-law hit the gas while I was out shagging a ball. Camera fell and the lens popped off and fell into the grass somewhere in the 15th fairway!Oh well, time for a new camera!  Know that a trip was coming up (Holy Land Tour) I decided to ask my wife for a really nice camera.  At first I was looking very hard at the Nikon D-60 and also an Olympus.  But then I happened upon the customer feedback for the Pentax K-200.  This with the fact I had a Pentax 70-200MM zoom lens orphaned to me years ago, sold me on this camera.I took the plunge and could not be happier!This camera rocks!  I'm still learning it, but even taking auto-auto pictures gives you superb pictures!Another thing that sold me is the weather proofing features that the others did NOT have.  Trekking around the dead sea and other dusty areas and having my camera ruined just isn't going to cut it!While this camera is a tad heavier than the Nikon, it's not unbearable by any means.Lastly, Pentax has been making cameras for decades and decades.  You've got a solid brand and reputation backing your purchase up.Have a Happy Thanksgiving and Blessed Merry Christmas to all!
