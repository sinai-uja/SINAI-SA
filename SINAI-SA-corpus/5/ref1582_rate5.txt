        The best choice for underwater., October 8, 2008
        ByRob Hendrix  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera for one thing and one thing only; it's ability to take photos underwater up to 33 feet without any other housing or attachments.  I'm very satisfied with that aspect.Check out the user photos for some pics I took from Grand Cayman.  90 percent of all my underwater shots (even when I couldn't see the screen because of glare or brightness of the sun) were very nice.The scene selection menu is very helpful when you need a quick way to get just the right settings for a photo.Out of the water, the pictures are fine if you aren't trying to zoom very far.  I'll keep shooting all my out of water photos with my Sony DSC-H5.  The Stylus just can't hold a candle to 12x optical zoom and a Carl Zeiss lense.
