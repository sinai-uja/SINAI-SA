        Brilliant!, November 8, 2007
        ByCynthia Farr-weinfeld (Portland, ME)  - See all my reviews
Having only used a Canon S3IS type point and shoot before this, I was apprehensive using the K10D for the 1st time.  But I quickly found that it is a remarkably user-friendly camera w/o the miriad menus its competitors use to accomplish all of the bells and whistles prosumer cameras have these days.  The manual is also top-class--actually offering instructions on how to use the different functions, such as Av and Tv, instructions of the like in a photographic manual.  Several weeks later, although I still have not tried EVERYTHING this lovely camera has to offer, I have been able to get many very nice shots, at all different conditions--light levels, weather, indoor and outdoor.  Even in simple green mode, you can take a marvellous picture, although I prefer TAv, Tv and Av largely as it offers me more creative license.  I feel that this camera has already helped me to expand my skillset as a photographer.  Not to mention that the kit lens (18-55 mm) is a truly fantastic lens--even w/o the shake reduction, in appropriate light levels, I have taken crystal-clear photos.  You will not be disappointed in this gem, and you'll love the metal body, the rubber grips and the 72 water seals which make it possible to shoot in wet conditions, although I wouldn't advise taking it for a dip!
