        It's done all I ask for., November 5, 2007
        ByD. Taylor "Studiousresearcher" (Dallas, Texas)  - See all my reviews
I bought this In August, been shooting with it since, just got back from a trip to the North Carolina mountains at the height of the autumn foliage season.  Everything worked great; image quality, color accuracy (important for me since I'm color blind, and have to ask others to make sure), image stabilization and autofocus worked well in low light situations, manual focus worked well for selectively focusing.  The camera has a great feel to my hands, everything is well sealed, and I feel no hesitation going out in a little misty rain (best time for some landscape shooting).  Oh, and excellent service from Cameta Camera, and no problem getting the rebates from Pentax for the Camera w/kit lens and 50-200 zoom.Pros:1. Weatherproofing.2. In body image stabilization (preserves usage of my expensive existing pentax lenses).3. Bright, large viewfinder, large dials, easy to navigate menus.Needs work:1. More persistent "Raw" setting would be nice.2. ISO setting also needs "set and leave it" capability.
