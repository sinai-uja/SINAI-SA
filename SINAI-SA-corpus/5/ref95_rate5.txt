I purchased this camera for my 70+ mother whose Kodak digital camera had died.  She found the transition to this camera very easy.  If you are at all familiar with digital cameras, the controls are very obvious and easy to use.  It uses regular AA batteries, so she doesn't have to worry about a special battery and charger.  A big plus.  At 8 MP, the photos are excellent quality, more than enough for making 4x6 prints or sending digital images with email or posting on the Internet.  I am a very advanced photographer and I thought this is a great point and shoot camera.
