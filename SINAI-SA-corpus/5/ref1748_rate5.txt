        Great digital SLR, January 13, 2008
        ByGeorge A. Banker Jr. "gbanker" (Raleigh, NC)  - See all my reviews
I own two other Pentax film SLRs (ME and ZX-7)and were happy with them, but this K10D is much more capable and a takes a better picture than the ZX-7.  I am still learning what some of the capabilities are as I go along (too much to learn at one time!) but have not found anything it cannot do as yet.  A digital (DA) f1.4 50mm lens is on my wishlist for the future.  It is a little heavy compared to my other cameras but not a real problem.  Also found I could use the same remote I already had besides the automatic lens from my ZX-7 camera.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes lots of features and great pictures.
