What more can I say?  I've had this camera over 6 months now. I used to use a Pentax K1000, went to point and shoot digital while my K-mount lenses collected dust, but became disenchanted with the limits of digital P&S cameras.  Several friends were buying Nikon or Canon dSLRs.  NIkon owners loved how they accepted older Nikor lenses. Envious, I was thrilled to find that Pentax has an affordable dSLR that'll accept my older collection of lenses.  Although the K200D is considered an entry level dSLR, I'm amaized at all it can do.  The image quality is superb. Its rugged, straight forward, a lot of fun.  I've taken it on horse rides in the Rockies, bird watching in snow and single digit (F)temps and it worked flawlessly - and still does.  I've never experienced any problems, not even with the lcd preview screen or battery life even in near zero F temperatures for several hours.  BTW, I've been using the rechargeable AA Energizer NiMH batteries and am getting flawless results for hundreds of pictures (well over 500) before needing to replace with a fresh set.I have nothing negative to say about this camera.
