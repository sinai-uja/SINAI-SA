This camera is loaded with features, easy to use and flexible for more than "Point  Shoot"... However the auto function is great !!I would highly recommend this camera for the under $150.00 price range. I am currently using it more than another camera I paid $600 for. Good value, good quality. You will have to increase the memory as soon as purchased.
