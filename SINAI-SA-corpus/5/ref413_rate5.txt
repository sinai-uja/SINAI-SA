I love this camera very much.  I just purchased a week ago and took with us to Disneyland.  I didn't get a chance to read the instructions before the trip.  This camera definitely is a user friendly camera.  I am no tech person at all.  It was very easy for me to take pictures with two young kids.I ended up took a lot of pictures without flash and they all turned out great.  Of course, it would be a good idea to know the camera before trip. :-)If you are looking for convenience, this is the one.  I am going to check out the underwate casing and hope to take this camera for scuba diving.Happy Summer!!!!!!!!!!!!
