        Sharp and Simple, April 28, 2008

I always look to CANON, when it comes to an imaging device.  I own several Canon cameras, (still and video), (2) printers and (2) scanners. The CANON SD1100IS does everything it claims with the same quality as the more expensive cameras do.  With the arrival of my 2 grandchildren, I wanted a camera that captured Clean, Sharply focused pictures quickly, since babies won't pose for you.  So far, since I purchased this at the end of March, I have taken over 300 photos.  At present, I have only charged the battery once and it is still ready to shoot.  The on-board effects add an incredible touch of professionalism to my pictures.  Sunlight, indoors, at night, ambient lighting without a flash, every picture a keeper!  If you are looking for versatility, simplicity, and great pictures you will be proud of, consider the SD1100IS.  I researched a lot of cameras, and the SD1100IS did all I wanted and more, for a very affordable price.
