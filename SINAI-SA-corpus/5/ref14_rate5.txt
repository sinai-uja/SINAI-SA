Considering what I paid and what I expected, this was a fantastic camera. I've been playing with the settings, as well as using "auto", and have had some great pictures all around. I will probably end up getting a small portable tripod because I have a hard time holding my hands still, so I can't blame the camera. It fits nicely in my hands (a big plus for me), and is not something I'm going to readily lose (another big plus for me). I've posted 2 pictures I took with this little camera, and am extremely pleased with my camera, especially when I considering how little I paid compared to much fancier cameras within this range/style.
