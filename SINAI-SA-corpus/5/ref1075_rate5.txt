I wanted a small point and shoot camera for in my pocket when I am not carrying my Nikon SLR, which is huge and bulky.  I miss too many shots that way.  I bought this one a couple of weeks ago and I am amazed.  The shots are clear, and good enough to be sold on stock photography sites that are very picky.  I even shot video with it to send to my husband in Iraq and it is as good as a small hand held video camera, and picture cameras never have that quality.  Buy this one!!  It is soooo worth the money :)
