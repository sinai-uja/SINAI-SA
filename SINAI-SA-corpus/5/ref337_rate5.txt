        Great camera, January 9, 2009
        ByL. Kollman (Riverside, IL)  - See all my reviews
I owned a Powershot A70 for years and when I was in the market for a new camera, I thought I would try the Kodak EasyShare M863.  I had tons of problems with that camera- flash wasn't working right, (it had to be sent in for warranty repair twice), images were blurry/not crisp and I could not see the LCD screen in bright sunlight (no viewfinder).  After so many problems I saw that Amazon had a good deal and good reviews on this Canon camera.  I have been using it for a few months now and so far I love it.  The picture quality is excellent (so much better than the Kodak), I love that is has a viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen and I love that it is easier to hold and take a steady picture with one hand (the slim cameras are very difficult to hold steady).  Another nice feature is that in "playback" mode, you can view what settings you had the camera in when you took the picture which is helpful when playing with the different settings to see what achieves the best picture.My only complaint like everyone states is that it really uses the batteries.  The batteries that came with the camera seemed to last a while but once those ran out and I switched to my rechargeables, it seems like I have to replace the batteries after every picture session.  I always keep extra charged batteries with me but I don't remember going through them so quickly with the A70.  Overall though I am willing to sacrifice a low battery life with high quality, easy to take pictures.
