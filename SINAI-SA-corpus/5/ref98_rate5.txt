        GREAT Camera!, January 6, 2009
        ByA. Fink  - See all my reviews
I own a Kodak V803 8 MP camera. That is a great little camera.... I love it I use it all the time to take pictures of my new baby and our dogs and family. Well my husband is going to Iraq so we needed two digital cameras. I researched budget digital cameras and this one came up #1 almost every single time. I told my husband which ever camera turned out to be better I was keeping! Well this camera blew me away! I didn't realize how washed out the background colors seemed to be with my other camera, it never captured the real light! This camera does! I love it, it takes great pictures, they are life like pictures and when looking at a picture I just took on the screen and looking up at what I took the pic of, they look exactly the same. I love this camera, and I'm so glad I got it!
