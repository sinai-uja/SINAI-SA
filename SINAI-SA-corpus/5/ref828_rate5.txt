        Love it!, August 26, 2008

I love this camera!  My husband lost our Canon PowerShot that we bought in 2006--yes, I nearly killed him--so we had no other choice but to buy a new model.  The 2008 model is by far superior to our 2006 camera and cost about $150 less!  Technology is improving so quickly!  But I love the size of this camera, the quality of the pictues are excellent, and I love the options and features.  Everyone should own this camera.
