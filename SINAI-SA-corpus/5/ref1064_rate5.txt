I have always been partial to Canon cameras.  Almost every product test or review I read gave this model best buy, or very high ratings.  (I also have a Canon DSLR). It's small, shirt pocket size, very capable and easy to use.  Produces great pictures.  I had admired this camera when it was priced much higher.  When I saw it on an Amazon special price, I grabbed it.  Just love it.
