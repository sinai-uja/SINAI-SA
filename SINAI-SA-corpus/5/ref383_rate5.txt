I bought this camera for a friend who needed it for work.  He had been using an old, crappy Kodak Camera.  He wanted my advice on what camera to buy but he only wanted to spend like $60.  I told him I couldn't recommend anything at that brice but in the low $100s I could get him a gem.  He agredd and is really glad he did.  I bought a Canon for my girlfriend that is only a couple notches above this one and she loves it.  I use Canon cameras for the videos and images I create for my site, SillyReviews.comThis is an excellent camera.
