Purchased this camera for my in-laws for Christmas.  They are in their early 80s and we wanted something easy for them to operate -- point and click basically.  The shape of the camera itself was also a consideration as it seemed easy to hold onto.  The quality of the pictures is fantastic!  They are extremely happy with the camera and its features.  Instructions that came with the camera were easy to follow as far as getting the pictures onto the computer which concerned them as they aren't very computer savy.   All in all, very happy with the purchase!
