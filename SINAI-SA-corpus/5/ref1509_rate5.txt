        Great lookin' camera, August 27, 2002

I've been searching for another digital camera since I sold my old one (Koday DC4800).  The two I was thinking about after a lot of research was the Minolta Dimage 7i and the Nikon 5700.  They are so neck and neck it was hard to choose.  I finally decided to go with the Nikon because of it's reputation as a quality camera, the 8x optical zoom (don't ever bother getting a camera based on its digital zoom, digital zoom is horrible), and the MP quality.  The main reason why I didn't get the minolta was the battery choice they made.  My first digital camera (Agfa ephoto 1680) used AA and it ran out within an hour of using it and swore I'd never do it again.  That camera was only a 1.? MP camera, the minolta is a 5 so you can imagine how bad it'll drain the batteries.  This camera can use different kinds but primarily uses a rechargable Li-ion.  And if you want, get the optional battery pack and you can use AA if you want (maybe a good idea if you don't want to spend the high price for extra Li-ion batteries).  Also since it's a 8x optical zoom you really only need to get the wide angle lens so you'll save money there.  My experience has shown that I have needed a wide angle a lot more than a telephoto lens.
