Very happy after 18 months heavy use.  This camera is great for the purpose I bought it for.  Creating high quality limited edition Giclee prints from original art work.  The 24" x 36" format is extremely good print quality on an Epson Large Format Photo Printer.Every aspect is good, the one weakness I sometimes wish was different, is the inability to zoom in the video recorder mode.  But I knew that when I bought it, and I bought it for the large format picture quality. Video recording is very good without the zoom.  For an everyday work camera I highly recommend it.  I have many lens and filters I use with it and often use with studio lights.  It will perform!  Use the manual settings just like any other 35mm works just the same if you wish.  Else auto won't let you down, Color second to no other.
