        Excellent Camera - Great Performance, September 13, 2007
        ByAvinash "Jumbi" (Boston, Ma)  - See all my reviews
The K10D - once you learn all the features, and tweak the settings to your liking - is a pleasure to work with.  The features are top notch - with a rugged feel - and the detail, contrast and overall image quality are excellent.The weather sealing means you don't have to be afraid to shoot in the rain or snow.  I like the RAW button where you can choose to shoot any picture in RAW+JPEG mode.  Even with the kit lens this camera captures good detail with nice contrast and saturation.  I consistently get a minimum of 500 shots (I usually lose count after a few hundred) on one charge.  Overall - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
