        Husband loves it and "can use it" easily , January 19, 2009

I am an advanced photographer.  My husband always wants to use my equipment.  I'm not really eager to do that considering my equipment has cost me thousands of dollars -- and he wants to take it to the hunting camp :) in the dirt, on the stand, in the water, etc., etc.  So............I am loyal Canon user.  This camera had great reviews.  Appeared to have a lot of the DSLR features and a bonus movie taking feature so I thought it would be a great "advanced function" camera for him.He will use the auto mode most of the time to take pictures but I am slowly teaching him all of the other advanced functions that he can use on the camera.  When I have shown him what functions this camera has in comparison to my SLR and we have been quite impressed.He loves this camera and for the price you get so many advanced functions it is well worth it.And if you drop it at the hunting camp you are not out thousands of dollars so "it's a good thing."
