        Love this camera!, February 28, 2006
        ByK. Bull (Baltimore, Maryland United States)  - See all my reviews
Every time I take the camera out and about for picture taking someone ultimately says "hey, nice camera". And it is. There are so many features Im still learning how to use them. I am definitely electronically challenged but the camera is easy to use. I Love the fact that I can take black and whites as well as color pictures. The digital zoom is amazing. I can capture so much detail. The only frustrating thing is the bulk of the camera. I recently went on a ski trip and didnt take alot of action photos on the slopes because I was afraid I would damage the camera if I fell. Its not like you can slip this thing in your pocket. It comes with a neck strap, which is good, for walking around with the camera but certainly not skiing around with it. Its a good price for the camera but because it is still expensive I feel I have to guard over it. The 1GB memory card I bought with the camera holds an unbelievable amount of pictures. The camera counts down the pictures you can take. Ive taken 180 pictures so far at 5megapixels. The camera says I have 600 more to go before memory is full.
