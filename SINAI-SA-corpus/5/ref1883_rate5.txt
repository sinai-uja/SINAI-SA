        Love it!, July 22, 2008

I absolutely love this camera.  It gives me the chance to learn and be creative while also using it as a "point and shoot" camera.  The shake reduction that is built into the Pentax K200 is awesome.  It's extremely difficult to take a bad shot.  :)  I've taken over 500 shots with the included Engergizer Lithium batteries and still have a full charge.  Now I'm addicted to buying lenses for it.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  I always aspired to buy a Cannon Rebel, but I can't imagine a camera being any better than this one especially for the price.  The feel to the camera is fantastic.  I thought I would miss the "live view" that I had with my other "point and shoot" cameras, but I'm adjusting well.  As other reviewers have said, the Pentax lenses are much more affordable since you don't have to pay for the shake reduction in the lens.  I'm giddy and having a blast taking great blurry free shots!
