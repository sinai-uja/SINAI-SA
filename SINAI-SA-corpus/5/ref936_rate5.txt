This is our third Canon digital elph model camera.  It takes very clear pictures and is simple to use.  The upload to the computer is quite easy.  There are just enough features that make it useful but not a waste.  It is quite popular with the teens - its size and, now its various color options, make it a hit.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.
