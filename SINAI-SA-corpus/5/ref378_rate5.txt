        Great Camera, Great Value, Great Hacking Project, December 21, 2008

I purchased my A590IS because of price and ease of hacking. Within minutes of receiving my camera I had installed CHDK on it and I had a camera with features of cameras costing much more. Now I can take awesome shots of lightning, save pictures in the RAW format, and take bracketed photos with ease. The quality of the camera is excellent and the Canon menus are easy to navigate and very intuitive. There are plenty of features for the experienced photographer and an Automatic mode that takes very nice pictures without any thought of ISO speed or any other variable. Battery life on the camera is reasonable, but I always keep a couple of extra batteries charged and ready to go. The body of this camera allows the use of accessory lenses. I purchased several of these lenses, along with the Canon adapter, and expanded the cameras capabilities even more. I like this camera so much that I am considering buying a second one so I can shoot stereoscopic images!
