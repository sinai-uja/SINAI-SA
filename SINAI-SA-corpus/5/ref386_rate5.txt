I purchased this camera about a week ago from Amazon to take the place of the Fuji Z20fd which only had an LCD screen on it and would black out in the sun.  I have been taking pictures with the Canon, then taking the same picture with the Fuji.  Canon wins hands down.  All the important controls are situated on the back of the camera which you can use without looking at them.  To save battery power you can turn off the LCD screen.  Mostly I shoot in auto mode but have been playing with it in the AE exposure mode which gives me more menu options and color effects. It also has optical image stabilization but doesn't deter from giving an excellent picture.  Colors are true, shadows are grey as they appear in life, not brown which is how the Fuji captured them.  Of course I'm more familiar with the Canon since I had a 6 mp one and loved it.  It stays in my purse so I'm ready for any shot that comes along.  Thanks to Amazon.
