        Awesome (and easy), January 18, 2009

I wanted a digital camera for around $100...I checked online for reviews and found this camera got great reviews. Even though it was a little bit more in cost, I think it's well worth it. Also, when I bought it the price was lower (I'd seen it for $149-$179) but actually paid $112.95 for it on Amazon. It's so easy to use (frankly I haven't even opened the manual yet). It takes great photos with no effort. And what I really love is that it takes great photos in the dark. I was at an event with very little light, and when I took pictures they came out just as well as if I was outside during the day. Great buy for the money, well worth it...and most importantly verrrry easy to use. Buy it, you won't be sorry.
