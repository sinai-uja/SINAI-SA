This is the third Olympus Stylus 1030 SW I've purchased in the last year for myself and family members.  We have had no problems with this camera at all and buying through Amazon is absolutely the way to go.The only negative feature with this camera is very, very low volumn when you use the video side of the camera and Olympus is aware of the problem.
