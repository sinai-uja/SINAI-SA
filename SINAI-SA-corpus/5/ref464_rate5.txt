        Great camera/great service, January 22, 2007
        ByDown To Earth  - See all my reviews
I knew i was buying a good camera but the features blow me away.It is definitely a great buy and the service from Amazon is always outstanding, it arrived faster than expect, and in the middle of the XMAS season. I had options to buy it cheaper in other sites but I decided to stay with AMAZON.
