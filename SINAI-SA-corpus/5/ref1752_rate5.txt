        Prosumer performance for budget conscious amateurs(and maybe even a pro or two), December 23, 2007
        ByChris Cunningham (Lexington, KY USA)  - See all my reviews
So far I've been really impressed with this camera.  I've used several brands, and I think it would be difficult to beat the K10D featureset for the price.  I'm switching from the Sony Alpha to Pentax for a couple of reasons, mainly that I don't have $1400 for A700, and I would really like to have something that's weatherproof, so it's not like the Sony stinks(or Canon or Nikon or Olympus stink), it's just that Pentax offers what I want for a price I'm willing to pay.  Image quality wise, I can't tell much difference between the brands I've owned and/or used on loan, the Pentax might be a little better at higher ISO's than the Sony.  Maybe.  But it takes some looking between similarly priced DSLRs and lenses to find any substantial difference in image quality.  I've used several(most) DSLR brands, and I would be hard pressed to pick out one over the other image quality wise.  Lens wise, I've use several moderate to low-end zoom lenses, and again, which maker has the image quality is kind of a toss-up.  They all perform well, and until you get into the 4 digit priced lenses, you're unlikely to actually measure much difference between the different makers.  In fact, I'm working on getting the money together now to buy pentax's 16-50 and 50-135 DA* zooms becuase they offer the features I want, much like the K10D.  The lenses maybe a bit pricey, but I think that they're alot of value for the money, again much like the K10D.  Frankly, I don't entirely understand why Pentax hasn't made more of a splash with this camera, I think it blows Nikon's D40x and Canon's Digital Rebel XT and XTI away from the standpoint of build quality and features for roughly the same price, and is a better value than Nikon's D80(sheesh it's $200 bucks more, still 10MP, and it's not splash and dust proof).
