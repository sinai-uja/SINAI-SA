        Don't get hung up on spec comparisons - it's a great camera at a great price., April 16, 2008
        ByJ. Fletcher  - See all my reviews
For those who know their camera models I'm an old school photographer - my first SLR was the v.basic Zenit E and my last SLR before owning a Pentax K10D was a trusty (but basic) Nikon FM. I did move on with the times though and have been digital for a while now with my (brick sized) Canon G2 compact.The K10D is a well made, robust camera and that is what is important IMO - the slight differences between the K10D and its SLR rivals from Canon, Nikon & Olympus etc are unimportant - ALL these brands make a cameras that 99.8% won't be restricted by whatever their photograpy.SLR camera spec is pretty much at an overkill level now - anything from the big brands in the last couple of years is going to be good. So my advice would be "see the wood from the trees" & don't worry about spec. Critically good photographs will come from you and your imagination rather than what brand or model of SLR you own.The Pentax K10D has recently been replaced by the K20D and hence the basement price ..., so bag yourself a bargain now and let others worry about whether a 3fps or 3.5fps rapid shooting mode is a critical factor in the decision making process.
