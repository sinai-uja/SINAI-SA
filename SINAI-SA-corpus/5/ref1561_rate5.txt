        Point and Shoot - Special features balance make it great, May 27, 2008
        ByArthur Held (Missoula MT)  - See all my reviews
This camera is NOT a replacement for a good DSLR. If you aren't expecting that, you won't be disappointed by this Point and Shoot (P))2. The menus are not complex, but there are a lot of options. There are settings that work for "instant" shots. But for more challenging situations there are great options - especially useful is the "portrait flash" options that let you highlight a face while not losing the background. It actually works as advertised.3. The lens is limited in aperture. This type of camera does not let you stop down to f/11 for that "perfect" depth of field shot. You are shooting around f/5 and changing the exposure time as you select different settings. What it sees is what you get.4. It's small. I have several great shots -- that feature my finger over the left 1/3 of the lens.5. it has the usual metering delay of P&S - so you can't take a TRULY instant shot - but there IS a feature called SHOOT&SELECT - which takes about 8 shots in "motor drive" mode - you then pick one or more that you want to keep. (you must do it NOW - before going on to the next shot, and it does take a moment for them to save.) But for action shots of kids, its fun and works well. SUMMARY: For a camera you can throw in your kayak, drop off your bike, keep in your jacket pocket, and let your kids take pictures from the monkey bars without worrying about, this is the perfect fit.
