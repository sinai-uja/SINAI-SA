        Great camera especially at this price, August 13, 2006

I researched and researched many cameras in this price range and finally settled on this one.  Previously I owned another Kodak Easy Share and was quite happy with it.  But it was 4 years old and needed to be replaced.  I am so glad I went with another Kodak.The pictures I take are far better than anything I thought I'd be able to capture. And the camera lets you mess with the light settings,etc. so I feel like I can get my feet wet with amateur photography, not just pointing and shooting.I take many pictures inside and have not had any problems with the quality.  I use the party setting for most of those and they turn out great.It is also very convenient that this camera can take lithium AA batteries.  That is all I use. I can't be bothered with rechargeables. Kodak made a lot of higher end options available to lower end budgets with this camera and I could not be happier about it.  I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase.
