Wonderful SMALL camera.  I set it on Auto and click away and every pic has turned out very clear.  Software installation went off without a hitch and camera transfers pics over in an instant.  Display is nice and bright.  Battery seems to keep the camera running for forever.  Still has viewfinder that's being dropped off of a lot of other cameras. I bought the gray case for the SD1000 that Amazon sells and it fits the SD1100 perfectly.  A little snug at first and then stretches out. Really need the case to protect the camera if you throw it in a pack with cellphones etc.  Bought 2GD memory card and it seems to hold a whole day the way I shoot but if I had it to do over I'd probably get 4GB.  All in all this camera surpassed my expectations.
