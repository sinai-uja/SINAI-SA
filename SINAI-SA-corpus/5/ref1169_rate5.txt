I love this camera! I've had it for over a year and would recomend it to anyone. I bought this camera after taking a backpacking trip with my friend and seeing the great shots her Easy Share took. I absolutly love it. I often take video of my 9 month old son because I don't have time to whip out the big camera. The video isn't super but it's fast and simple. I just use the Windows Camera Wizard to get all my photos off it so I've never used their software, but I've never had a problem. ::thumbs up::
