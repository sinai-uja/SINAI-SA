        ByBrandon G. Sabala  - See all my reviews
I was hesitant to spend the money on this camera but after I did, I was very pleased and would have spent another $50-100 on it.  So many options to use, great picture quality, and the rotating screen very helpful for taking pictures of yourself for webpages and other uses.  If you take a picture and view it while turning the camera sideways the picture will rotate anyway you turn the camera except the upside down position. Any otherway the picture will rotate with you, it was something I was in aaahhhh about the first time I discovered it.  It caught me off guard the first time I discovered it since I never read directions anyways.
