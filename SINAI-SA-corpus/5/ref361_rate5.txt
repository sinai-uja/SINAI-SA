This camera is a great one. It has a large screen that shows clear images. The shots I have taken have all been accurate and clear. There are many easy-to-use features on the camera including an easy mode that I like so much. The camera is a very good buy with its 8 megapixels, 4x zoom (very good zoom), Optical Image Stabilizer, and 2.5-inch LCD (also lightweight and looks sharp). I am really enjoying it.
