Great product with a fantastic variety of easy to use features. There are also automatic and easy photo modes for those who are more inexperienced with photography. Overall this is an excellent camera for the price, and Cannon's customer service has already proven to be very helpful to me regarding any concerns I had.  When compared to other cameras in this price range, I found this to be the best camera available. I have tried others, and most do not rival the picture quality and versatility of this Powershot A590.  This is a definite buy!
