        Excellent affordable DSLR, February 16, 2009
        ByMicah C. Campbell (Dallas, TX)  - See all my reviews
I am very happy with my purchase. I researched cameras for about a month and finally decided on the K200D. I am very happy with my decision and cannot imagine a better product for the price i paid. I highly recommend this camera to any looking to upgrade from a point and shoot to an intermediate to experienced photographer. Of course it doesnt have all of the feature of high end pro cameras, but it does have a lot more than you'd expect from an entry level DSLR. Especially when compared to the offerings from Nikon (D40-D60) and Canon (XTi-XS). This is my first DSLR, so I'm by no means a dedicated Pentax enthusiast as of yet. In fact, I may switch brands in the future if necesarry, but as of right now, I am definitely content with my purchase and would have no problem recommending Pentax products.
