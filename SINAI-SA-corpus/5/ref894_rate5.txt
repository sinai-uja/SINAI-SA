        ByJ. Buerk  - See all my reviews
I have had the camera since the holidays and have been very happy with it so far.  It starts up fast and is ready to capture pictures just about anywhere.  The pictures are vivid and well lit.I've used the party (indoors) shooting mode with great success.  I captured the party streamers shooting across the room at a birthday party.  In the Kids and Pets shooting mode I've captured great pictures of the cat and dog playing.  Once you learn to use the different modes you can get very creative.  Although I have yet to try the vivid color mode, you can create special effects in the camera without using photo editing software.  It even offers manual settings for those who want to tweak their photos.
