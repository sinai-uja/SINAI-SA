Great camera for the money.  Canon is always good quality and this is no exception.  I'm very happy with the shots I've taken and I haven't even had the time to go thru the book and see all that it will do.  It has lots of options in addition to just point and shoot.  Highly recommend it.  My single complaint is that Canon cut corners by putting on a flimsy little piece to open for the AV/DC in-out.  It's no big deal, but it doesn't match the high quality of the rest of the camera.
