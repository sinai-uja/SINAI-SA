This is our first digital (I know, we live like cavemen) and I absolutely love it.  Everyone is soooo jealous when I swivel the screen.  It is perfect size FOR US but my sister said, OMG thats huge! Have had no problems, bought the rechargeable batteries and they are still on first charge after several months and hundreds of pictures.  I am not a techy but even I feel comfortable with this camera.  Love the quality.
