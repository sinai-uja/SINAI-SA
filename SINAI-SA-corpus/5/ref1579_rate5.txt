I am very happy with this camera. As an avid amateur photographer I hate being without a camera at all times. My Olympus Evolt 510 is great but too bulky to carry all the time. The 1030SW fills the bill as a snapshot camera. Water (and weatherproof) I never have to worry about it getting wet in the constant rain in SE Alaska were I live. Its small enough to slip in a pocket and takes very good pictures as well as good video. Shutter lag is minimal which has been a problem with other digital snapshot cameras. the body is small and very slippery, but the addition of a silicon skin makes it easy to hold. The photos are very sharp and the relatively large screen helps to frame shots well. I always shoot pictures at the highest resolution and the 2GB xD card holds well over 100 shots so I am not limited with the number of photos I can take. I look forward to obtaining a housing, and using this little gem while diving.My 2 minor problems with the camera are the easy of including fingers over the lens in shots, especially when shooting quick action shots, and the lack of raw mode. I have become spoiled with my DSLR, shooting in raw mode and the ease of manipulating the files. I suppose one can't have everything for under $450.00.Nitejazz
