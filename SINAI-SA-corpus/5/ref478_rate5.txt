        great camera for the price, May 26, 2007
        ByA. Alonso "anival" (Georgia, USA)  - See all my reviews
pros: great picture quality, good battery life, accessories come cheap, and good variety of features and options.cons: pictures go grainy with noise at high iso settings, lack of picture stabilizer.great for beginners and those who want a great camera without paying the big bucks for the xlr cameras.
