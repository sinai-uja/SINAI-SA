Without a doubt the best overall camera in its class. I have bought the powershot class cameras since they came on the market. I have upgraded as features are added or MPs significantly increase. To date between my wife and childern we have bought at least 5-6 powershots and never been sorry that we did.The ease of use and quality of construction coupled with a sofisicated menu of options makes purchase of this camera a very wise investment. At less than $150.00 it is truly a best buy.
