        ByLady of Shallott (Chicago, IL)  - See all my reviews
I'm not good at taking pictures.  I'd like to say I am ... but I've known for years that it's just not true.That is ... until I bought this camera.  I've gleaned more "good" pictures from what I've snapped in the brief time I've owned this marvel - than I've taken in my entire life!!  (and I'm STILL learning the camera!!)I carry it with me everywhere ... *EVERYWHERE* I get so many compliments on the photos I've taken!!  Now, I don't have any great aspirations of being any sort of photographer -- I bought the camera to take pictures of my work to share for progress photos on a project -- still, I find myself taking photos of other things as well.  Before, taking a photo was amongst the list of last things I would do! All I can say is BRAVO!! great price - great product - worth MORE than what you pay!!!
