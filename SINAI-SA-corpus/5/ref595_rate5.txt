        A great value, January 4, 2007

I love this camera.  I only have limited experience with digital cameras but I think this camera is a great value.  I especially like the rotating viewfinder (or whatever it's called).  You can even turn it 180 degrees so that you can take a picture of yourself.  I used it at a baseball game and turned the viewfinder 90 degrees to see around a corner - it was great.  Frank Robinson never saw it coming.
