        ByJoe133 (So. Ca)  - See all my reviews
The camera's features are more abundant and much easier to figure out than with the 4 year old 3MP Olympus I was using.   Have not even looked at the manual.  I wish Canon had put on a larger flash as the light drops off in the picture at about 10-12 feet.  But taking pictures outside with sun that is not an issue. I have taken about 400 pics using the flash set to auto still using the original set of batteries (copper tops).  Camera has shutter priority and aperature priority, features usually found on more expensive equipment.  I am happy with my purchase as the the lens fully retracts into the body and covers itself and am able to carry it in my jeans pants pocket for easy portability.  For the money you can't beat this camera.
