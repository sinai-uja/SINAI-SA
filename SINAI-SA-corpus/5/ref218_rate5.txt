Good easy to use camera with large LCD screen. One user review said it did not work with rechargeable batteries, well, I didn't have any problem using the rechargeable batteries. This camera did not work with previous Canon software I had in my PC (for A520 and EOS 10D), and it was a lot of trouble to replace software, which I did not succeed. But, take SD card out of this A590 and insert it in A520, I was able to download the A590 images to PC via A520( I don't know if this causing degraded resolution or not). Otherwise, A590 is a good value, especially if you don't have to fiddle with your software.
