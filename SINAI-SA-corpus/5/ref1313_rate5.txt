        how I spent my summer vacation, July 12, 2006
        ByI LOVE ELIES. "elephant lover" (wellsboro, pa)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this camera (much cheaper than walmart) for taking pictures of my kids this summer.  I took it camping and got great shots of them and other things. with the kodak easyshare program the pictures are edited and look great.  I really like it and can't wait to take it to las vegas  in two weeks.Thank you Amazon for a great product at a great price.
