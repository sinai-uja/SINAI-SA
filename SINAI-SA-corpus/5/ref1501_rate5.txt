        Upgrade from Coolpix 800 to Coolpix 5700, October 1, 2002
        By A Customer
Bought the 5700 as an upgrade to my 800 because I need the extra megapixels and love it.  Had to prove to my wife that the upgrade is justified, so I took several photos today with both cameras, and the 5700 won hands down, giving me much better enlargements and better color, too.  ...  Am now ordering accessories from Amazon, especially a 128M compact  flash card, since Nikon only provides a pathetic 8M card...
