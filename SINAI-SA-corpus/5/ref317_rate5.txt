        Surprisingly good little camera, little $$$, January 7, 2009

Wife got me this for Christmas, because my trusty Coolpix 880 died.Lots of manual control, flash is a bit weak, a off-camera flash portwould have been nice. Hey, for $109- who cares? Very good image quality,flesh tones go a little pink, but all Canons have had that and easilyfixed in photoshop. Short video clips are a plus, too. Best buy sells these for $50 more than Amazon, get a brain and stop buying in brick and mortar stores. Unless you don't need money. If that be the case, send it to me, LOL
