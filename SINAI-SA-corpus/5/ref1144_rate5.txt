        ByJohn L. Helms  - See all my reviews
I love this camera!! I really like the clear detailed pictures it takes.I always use auto,and its perfect for me.I take tons of family photos.I have taken thounsands of photos with this camera and love them!!Iv never had better pictures.It also has great video too,I have a video camera,but find myself useing this more  for video than my video camer.Because its just so hadny.And I can transfer my videos to cd to watch on tv.I take pictures of my kids sleeping at night,and the room is totaly dark,and when you see the photo youd never know it was takin at night.Because it looks like it was taken during the day,thats how great it lights up the room when you take a photo at night.
