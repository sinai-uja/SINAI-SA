        ByS. Stevens (Georgetown, KY United States)  - See all my reviews
I've owned several camera's over the years and this is by far the best camera I have ever owned!  There are so many setting to use it's practically impossible to take a bad picture.  If you are interested in an easy to use but fully featured camera than this is the camera for you!  Amazing!
