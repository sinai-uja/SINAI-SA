I have owned the Canon PowerShot A70 for several years.. I was overdue to upgrade.. This camera is great!- SD memory is very small, and takes less power and holds more images.. even at 8 MP!!- The swing-away LCD is very convenient!- Large enough to hold on with out shaking! (smaller cameras aren't steady)optics are excellent. - Imagery is fantastic for 8 MP. - AA batteries can be had anywhere.. and rechargeable ones are inexpensive.- SCN modes help lighting, Aperture, Exposure etc.The camera's functions can be a bit overwhelming.. but offer so much control!Summary: Good quality camera. Point and shoot enthusiast and control fanatics!Canon makes solid products!Amazon Prime fantastic shipping and service!
