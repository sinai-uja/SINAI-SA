I'm just starting out with a "real digital camera". This is a perfect camera for learning photography. Or for a quick point and shoot. My mother is a photographer and a friend of mine is too and they both like it alot with all of the features it has. I'm learning alot on this camera and it's been fun! The first A630 had a problem when I recieved it, the flash wouldn't work and the Canon tech support was a big help, and they were suprised that it was defective (very rare) they told me. No problem with exchange from where I got it. Battery life is excellent with plain old alkaline, but get rechargeables. Video mode is very nice and I love hooking it up to my TV. Macro shooting is the best as well as night shooting. I've made some crazy light trail shots of moving cars at night. Can't wait to try it during the Fourth of July fireworks! The LCD screen is great and the view finder is nice too, actual it zoom in as well. Like I said it is the best camera for learning on, it will show you if you make an error before you shoot. It also has a quick startup, and you have alot of custom features on it. The software it comes with is easy to use. I'm a firefighter and I can't wait to try it on a call or training. Awesome camera....get one!!
