This is a great camera, I have taken many pictures with the batteries right out of the box and they are still going strong. The many option to the camera are easy to figure out without having to research a lot i the books. The camera shuts down fast and turns on quickly. Both are good for saving battery life on shut down and if the perfect picture comes up you can get the shot.The large LCD screen on the back is nice for viewing your pictures and looking at menu options without having to squint your eyes. I will be purchasing rechargeable batteries soon when the original batteries die so I can get even longer life before having to change the batteries out again.
