Ordered this camera as a bundle with the companion soft camera case and 2GB picture card for my husband.  Handsome, sleek and extremely functinal.  My husband is in the diving and marine industry so the underwater, waterproof and impact features are a must.  Sharp pictures also needed for job visuals and reports.  Camera has definately stepped up to the plate regarding all of these features.  Great camera for a fair price!
