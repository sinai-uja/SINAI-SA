Having used a Sony Mavica FD83 digital camera for a long time we recently purchased this new Canon digital camera last month. We are pleased with the camera, written instructions, software, compactness and many, many features. It will probably take us some time to figure out all of the things this camera can do. I really like the automatic setting the camera provides which takes great pictures and I don't have to figure out intricate settings to get a good picture. There are also lots of add-ons we can get and will soon purchase the telephoto equipment and rechargable battery equipment. Meanwhile, we are taking super pictures using standard AA batteries. You will definitely need a bigger SD card because this camera takes some big pictures and will use up the included SD Card real fast.
