        Fabulous!  Just what I wanted, July 27, 2008

Just a short note to let you know that I had some reservations about this item because of the claims of short battery life.  I looked at a lot of other cameras and was hoping for some great features without having to go to the fancy schmancy cameras. For the price, I think it's a great buy.  It is easy to use, it has a lot of great features and you can use manual functions but I haven't needed to yet because of all of the options including "night scene", "kids and pets", "foliage" and so on.  The camera came with two basic alkaline batteries and I've literally taken a couple hundred pictures and they're still working.  I don't use the flash very often, so this may contribute to the longer battery life, but I generally use rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, so I'm not too worried about the future battery life once these freebies wear out.
