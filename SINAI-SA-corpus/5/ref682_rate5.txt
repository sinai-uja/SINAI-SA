        Great camera, August 29, 2007
        ByNorCal (San Francisco, CA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera in June, 2007 for a month-long trip to South America. I had wanted a higher MP camera to possibly print some 11x14 and higher posters.  In short, I'm thrilled with the purchase.I was expecting this to just eat AA batteries like my old Canon A70. I had even packed a ton of batteries for my trip in anticipation of this. Instead, I was able to take 200-300 pictures on each set of batteries.The 8MP was also plenty and the shots we made into posters turned out great.Finally, the camera also takes great pictures in all modes. I especially feel like the night shots came out much better than my previous A70. The audio on movie mode was also much improved over older models.  The ONLY slight con is that framing a shot with the viewfinder sometimes produces mixed results. I think the actual picture taken tends to be a little bigger than what you see in the viewfinder....for example if you frame a shot to avoid a tourist in the viewfinder, that person may still make an appearance in your photo. In these situations, I just used the LCD screen which seemed to be a more faithful representation of the photo to be taken.
