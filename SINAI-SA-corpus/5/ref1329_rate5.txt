Once upon a time, I had another (smaller) Kodak digital camera. When it finally decided it was ready to die, I started looking for another Kodak to replace it.  After looking at Amazon for quite a few months, I decided on the Z740.  I got it on my birthday and have been in love with it ever since!It's so easy to use, takes great pictures, and the software allows me to manipulate my pictures in a variety of ways.  I take it everywhere in case I need to capture something spectacular and it never lets me down!  I'd buy another Z740 and I'd definately buy from Amazon again!
