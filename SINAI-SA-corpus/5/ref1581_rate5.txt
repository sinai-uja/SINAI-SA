        Great Gift for Friend on the Go, October 9, 2008
        ByT. Schauer "hacker, photographer, designer" (University Place, WA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this for my friend that is heading to China to pick up his "to-be-adopted" daughter, Lily.  My friend uses gadgets but is generally uncomfortable with electronics and the intricacies of tweaking options, downloading pictures, etc. He is also pretty rough on stuff.  I can see him dropping the camera, splashing it, etc.So this camera seems a perfect fit for him.  So far he says the shutter delay is much less than his previous camera (an old model Canon point and shoot).  He says he has great comfort knowing this camera is indestructible.  I can see him using it more knowing that he isn't likely to ruin it by having it with him all the time.  He loves the video feature.I didn't get a chance to see the image quality so I cannot comment.  I wish I could.I'll add more to this review later if I get more specifics from him.
