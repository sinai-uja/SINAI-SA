        ByLynn H. Pierson "LHPierson,PhD." (Cincinnati, OH)  - See all my reviews
I bought the camera just 3 days before leaving for Spain.  The directions were adequate and the camera is really easy to use.  I not only shot photos on automatic but used the night and color options, as well as did a few movies.  The software was essential because I prefer more contrast to my photos and the software allowed me to customize the images as I liked.  It was not clear to me on Amazon that the camera came with a recharger (it did) so I purchased a recharger.  Turned out that was smart because it came with a European electrical outlet adapter that I used in Spain.  I also purchased a 4G memory card.  I took 535 photos and 5 movies, and there seems to be more room.  For it's size (I carried the camera in my front pants pocket) it takes amazing pictures.  I definitely recommend the camera.
