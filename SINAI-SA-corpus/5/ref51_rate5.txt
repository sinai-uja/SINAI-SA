        Great Camera for the price!, February 6, 2009

I love this camera. I do astrophotography, and this camera is the best low light digital I've seen so far. I have a Kodak EasyShare C653, and it too is a great camera for the daytime shots but this Canon really out does it in low light conditions. It has the manual features of a more expensive camera, for half the price. You'll find it extremely hard to beat, or even match this camera's features for the price... and oh by the way... I found the best price here. This camera rocks, I can stand outside my back door and point it at a constellation, or group of stars and point and click... and the shot is mine. I couldn't believe how easily it took shots of the stars. Thanks Canon... nice job!
