        Great Camera!, June 1, 2008
        ByCoffee Lover  - See all my reviews
Great camera, takes beautiful pictures it has lots of features, 4X zoom (most compact and ultracompact cameras have a 3X zoom), for those who want to step away from the auto mode it has manual controls to take even better pictures, it may seem a little bulky for some, it is not certainly the kind of camera you would carry in your shirt pocket without it looking a little droopy, if you are looking for something really small try the SD1100 IS, but if you are looking for a great compact camera this is the one. Rememeber it runs on AA batteries,(you can buy AA in any drugstore when your on vacation), so it can't be as small as the ultra compact models that run on Li-ion battery packs.
