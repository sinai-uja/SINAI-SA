        Nice addition to an older Powershot, November 21, 2008
        ByOrdinary guy  - See all my reviews
This camera caught my eye as a great replacement for my aging Canon PS A80.My main concerns were battery life and durability.  The A80 uses four AA's and good battery life and has stood the test of time. The A590IS uses only two AA's which makes it a little bit smaller, which makes it more pocketable, and with the newer battery technologies is very acceptable as far as battery life. The A80 takes great pictures with a mere 4meg pix so the upgrade to 8 was not a selling point.  The 590 does have a little bit better video capability which was a selling point.....and the recent low price definately sealed the deal.At any rate this is a great little camera and should please most newbies and the majority of older Canon PowerShot owners.
