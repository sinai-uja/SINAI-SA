        CANON POWER SHOT, February 24, 2009

I received my first Power Shot as a gift. Five months later it took a hard drop and the screen broke.  I like this camera so much and bought the same one as a replacement.  There are so many easy to use settings and the Macro is excellant for close ups. I recently used the kid/pet setting which is now one of my favorites.  I am no fan of complicated items.. This is so easy to use. I would recommend it and I would give it as a gift.
