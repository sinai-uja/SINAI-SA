after having an ancient 1.3 mega pixel camera since 2000 last october (2004) i decided to buy a newer updated digital. after a bit of searching i settled on the CX7430. at the time it was about $200 which was a great price i love the camera. it has B&W and sepia settings, even though the screen is a bit small the quality is great. also updloading on the computer is simple. great quality fun camera i recommend.
