I love this camera.  I'm just a point and shooter but am having a great time learning how to use the more advanced features that this camera has to offer.It takes great pics with the auto setting but I have been using the "P" program mode with the "my colors" set to vivid to get great pics of the fall foliage.The video feature also works great and records sound as well.You can spend thousands on a digicam but for the casual photographer like myself, this camera rocks.  And at a price almost anyone can afford.Oh yea, the macro feature on this camera is fun to play with getting great close up pics of things like flowers, close ups of abe's face on a five dollar bill, etc.....The 32 MB card that comes with the camera can only take 8 pics at the highest resolution, so make sure you get at least a 1 gig card.  The price of the SDHC (high capacity) cards at Amazon were so inexpensive that I bought a 4 gig Sandisk Ultra II card for an extra[...]I also bought the genuine Canon carrying case for another [...].  It has a belt loop which makes it easy to carry around.For the money, the Canon A590is is an awesome value.  Highly recommended.Lionel Teixeira
