If there's a better digital camera in the Canon PowerShot A590IS price range, well ... I don't think that's possible.This camera produces nothing but great photos, is very easy to use and definitely is one of the best purchases I've made in years.I'm far from being an electronics wizard, but learning how to use this sweet camera and all of its functions was easy for me.If you're contemplating buying a digital camera, I definitely recommend considering this fine Canon product. Believe me, you won't regret it once you start taking photos.
