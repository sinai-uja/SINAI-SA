        The Canon Family, July 24, 2007

I have a long list of canon cameras at use in my house. This one really surprised me! it is so much better than the compact cameras I currently had. It ,of course, takes great pictures! I had an A95 and upgraded to the 630. What an upgrade. The Macro shot ability of the 630 is incredible, the large view screen is sweet and the ability to flip the screen out for different bizarre angles is more of a plus than most people realize. The A95 has this feature as well, and when upgrading to the 630, I was not going to give up this sweet option.all in all this is one of the best compact digital cameras I have had. No, it is not tiny, but, I am 6' tall and this camera doesn't feel like I am holding a deck of cards and trying to take a picture.
