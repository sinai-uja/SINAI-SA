        A very good camera, September 8, 2007
        ByRodrigo Duarte "Rod" (Santiago, Chile)  - See all my reviews
I own this one, and had an A620 before.Very good image quality and controls. Excellent battery life. of course , it is a bit pn the bulky side, so large pockets or a camera case are useful (mine lives in my backpack).The rotating screen on the back is priceless, as it allows for inconspicuous shooting of subjects who resent being photographed.
