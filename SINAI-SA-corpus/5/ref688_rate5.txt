        Excellent camera, June 11, 2007
        ByJeanne  - See all my reviews
Takes great pictures.  Most valued features for me are the long battery life relative to number of pictures one can take and the moveable view finder.  It has way more features than i will ever use, but that is true of all the cameras I looked at.  It was a reasonable price and highly rated by Consumer Reports and the salesperson at Best Buy even though I didn't purchase there.  Even though it is not the smallest model, it easily fits in my purse.
