        Excellent point-and-shoot camera, February 2, 2009

The Canon PowerShot 8MP is an excellent platform for shooting family pictures.  Right now I'm getting pictures of two rambunctious dogs and get no-blur, crisp pictures every time.  I highly recommend this for an easy-to-use camera for all members of the family!
