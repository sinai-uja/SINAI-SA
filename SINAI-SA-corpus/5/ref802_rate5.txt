        EXCELLENT TINY CAMERA!, December 2, 2008
        ByA. Noel (Baton Rouge, Louisiana)  - See all my reviews
I just got this camera after my old one broke, and I really wanted a nice compact one. This camera is in fact very small, and very easy to use. I really love it. It takes excellent pictures, and has a lot of options for different settings, light, speeds.. You can see some pictures i uploaded using the "digital macro" option, you can actually see ice crystals formed on the grass, a rose, and another plant, on a frosty morning.
