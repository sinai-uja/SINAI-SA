        Fabulous Camera and Simple to use, January 6, 2009
        ByFather of Five "Brent" (Salt Lake City, UT)  - See all my reviews
I've been looking for an easy-to-use 10MP point and shoot camera because it was the newest in technology. Then I read some reviews that the 10MP cameras gave up a lot of the nice features (like 3X optical zoom) found in the 8MP cameras, whereas the extra 2MP just didn't matter for 99% of users. So I turned to the 8MP Canon Powershot, read MANY of the reviews and bought it for my trip to Hawaii. The camera performed beautifully. The photos are extremely sharp and colorful. It's VERY easy to use and VERY compact.In some of the reviews people complained about the "lense fault error" and I got a little spooked about it. But now that I've had the camera, I've also had the same error 2 or 3 times because I was holding the camera with the lense against the palm of my hand when I turned it on. The camera immediately halted to prevent lense damage. All I did was turn it off and back on and it was just fine.There's plenty of manual options to set if you get into those special effects, but I just prefer to set it on auto and point and shoot. All my Hawaii photos turned out beautiful and I'm not disappointed one bit on purchasing this camera. One warning, however: The photo card that comes with this camera only holds about 8 pictures! So get an 8 GB card for about $20 and you'll run out of scenery before you run out of space!
