        Great Camera!, September 5, 2007
        ByAngela Blair (Lewisburg, WV United States)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera for a weekend trip to NYC. It was just what I wanted. The photos are ridiculously crisp. I'm a casual photo taker and have had no problems. I hope to learn the fun tricks with this one. No complaints. I have yet to change the batteries and have used it every day for almost a month. I purchased an additional 2gig SD card for the camera and it has plenty of room for my day-t-day activities. Overall, this camera is a 5 of 5. [I browsed the comments on the additional one and two-year warranty and decided against it, make sure you read the reviews on that warranty before buying it.]
