This camera replaces an older Canon digital. I wanted a camera with no fancy settings and very easy to use in a small product. I liked the idea of this one using long lasting and cheaper Sanyo Eneloop AA batteries. I will not be printing or blowing up many if any pictures so this 8MP with 4X Zoom more than fits my needs. I primarily use this for E-bay and family shots that I store on discs. While I am still learning how to operate this camera, I do notice that the time it takes to shoot one picture after another does take a bit of time, several seconds. The quality seems to be good and I am happy so far.
