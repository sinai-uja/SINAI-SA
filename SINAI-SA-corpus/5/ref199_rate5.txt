this is my first and only digital camera, so not an expert review. After reading other reviews, I was concerned about being able to shoot fast enough and battery life, but neither of these have been a problem for me. the menus were easy to navigate, and I figured out how to use most of the features in about 1/2 hour. Considering the price, and the throwaway world we live in, it seems well-made. I was shocked that the included memory card(16MB?!) would only hold 10 photos,but found an 8GB card for +/-$25...
