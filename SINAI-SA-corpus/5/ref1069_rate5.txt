We did close-up photos on flowers and even hair and eyelashes and it's amazing what resolution we had with the camera and with such clarity. The camera is easy to use and is small sleek and compact. I got the one in brown and it looks unique and sohpisticated without looking too overly girly or masculine. Sound quality through the video recording was crisp and images were nice and clear and not at all pixelated. Definitely a good buy and well worth the money.
