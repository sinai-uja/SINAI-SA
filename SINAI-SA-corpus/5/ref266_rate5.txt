        Great little camera, awesome pictures, January 27, 2009

I had a Kodak 330 and this Canon Powershot A590 IS is hands above that old camera. The camera actually focuses on your subject and takes ultra clear, gorgeous pictures. It has a nice place to hold it, so it feels secure in your hand. Lots and lots of features to take pictures, more than I'll ever use. Great options to go completely manual and a combination of manual/automatic. I've used the "snow" scene option quite a lot and the pictures come out great. One drawback is there is no internal memory, so you have to have a memory card; which is stored in the same space as the battery. Not a big deal for me, but some complained about it. I purchased a 4GB card, as you do have the option to take large picture files.Compared to the Kodak this camera feels more sturdy and better construction. Some complained of a flimsy feeling construction, but I don't find that. This camera also has the option of interchangeable lenses, but you first need to buy an "adapter" and then the lens. I probably won't do that as that will cost even more than the camera!Some complained about short battery life. It doesn't seem much different from the Kodak I had and I just replaced the batteries from the original after having it for a month. Now I am using rechargeable batteries.The cycle delay with flash photos is longer than I would want, but that is a minor inconvenience compared to all the great features and awesome pictures I get. I definitely would recommend this camera. It's great for someone who dapples in photography and wants some manual options as well as for the casual user who will only use the auto options.
