I absolutely love this camera.  I purchased the Canon PowerShot 1100IS after carrying my Fuji SLR for years.  I had no problems with the SLR, but it was entirely too bulky.  Therefore, I wanted something that gave me similar picture quality from my SLR, but in a compact.  After doing a little research, I purchased the 1100IS.  This has been a purchase that I have not regretted.  The camera has great manual controls which allow you to keep customize settings such as white balance, flash, timers, etc.  Another feature I like is the way the screen changes depending on the way you have oriented the camera.  My friends love when I carry this camera because it takes such good pictures.  Everyone who I send pictures of themselves or who I've allowed to use the camera to take pictures wants to know where I got my camera.  I have had 2 or 3 express interest in going to purchase this camera.  You will not be dissappointed with this camera!
