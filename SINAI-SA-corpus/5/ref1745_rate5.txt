        Perfect even for serious beginners, January 31, 2008

A little back story: my interest in photography started just a few months ago, after I started collecting desktop wallpapers. It doesn't hurt that my girlfriend is beautiful. So, with only basic point  it doesn't feel like a toy. I also like the way the controls were laid out on the back, and the dual dials plus extra exposure modes together with the green button really make things a snap.The only cons: ISO performance beyond 800 could be better, and some people may like having dedicated buttons for ISO and WB, though the new firmware makes selecting ISO a lot faster. Oh, and you might find yourself spending a lot of time taking lots and lots of pictures...If you're serious about having better control over your pictures and getting great image quality without breaking the bank, go for the K10D. You can use the money you saved to buy all the new and old lenses that the K10D can still mount. You won't regret it; I sure didn't.
