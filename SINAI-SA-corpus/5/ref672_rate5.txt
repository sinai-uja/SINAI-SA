        Awesome Camera, May 29, 2007
        ByM. Reza Hussain (Dallas, TX)  - See all my reviews
Terrific equipment. Canon proved it again. Very easy to use unit, comes with lots of features, and delivers excellent picture. I used to own another Canon P&S unit (A-70) but LCD on A-360 is much better. The capability to rotate the LCD adds another dimension to the flexibility of this product. So far, I used two different ASA settings, i.e.  ASA 200 and ASA 400. The picture quality in each case was superb. Downside if any would be the SD Card that comes from the factory has very limited capacity, 16MB only. You ought to have a card with much higher capacity. Overall a brilliant product to own for any level of camera user expertise.
