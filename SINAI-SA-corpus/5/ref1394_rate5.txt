I researched cameras for about a month and came to find this one the best for what I was going to use it for.  I am not great with electronics and this camera was made for electronically challenged people like me.  I am taking a trip to Ausrtralia this summer and needed a camera that could take pictures quickly and was easy to navigate through in a hurry.  I didn't want to miss the oppertunity of a life time.  This camera can take pictures so quickly and you can press the review button and in a flash look at what you had just taken.  My favorite feature is the explanation of the differant picture modes.  It even has grass, snow, sky, children, party, and many others.  This camera also has a tv hook up to do a slide show.  All you have to do is plug in your cords to the tv and turn your camera on.  This was amazing.  You set your camera up ahead of time- select which pictures and how long you want the intervols to be(which is very easy).  There is also the option to create folders for your pictures.  I have a folder for holiday and one for Australia so far.  This camera has alot of features, but not too many to confuse you.  It also is easy to hold with one hand so you can do something else too.  As far as I know it hasn't eaten up batteries, which is a big plus!  This camera is great all the way around for a begginer such as myself.
