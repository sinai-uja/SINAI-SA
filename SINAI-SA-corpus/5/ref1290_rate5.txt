        Great Camera!! , October 2, 2005
        ByV. Gioia (Phx, AZ)  - See all my reviews
Previously, I owned a Canon digital that I was very happy with, but it was only a 2mp with 3x optical zoom. So if I was ever going to get a new one, I was going to upgrade. After having it for about 6 years, it has started to die on me.  My job requires me to use and sell cameras and to develop film, so you can only imagine how hard it was for me not to buy a camera everytime I saw a new one come out. They only get better every year! I actually was in the market for the 6490 model, but it was discontinued, so then I was researching the 7590 and waiting for a good price. Then I found this one on the Kodak website, and it is almost exactly like the 7590, except it takes AA's instead of the rechargeable lithium battery, which I really wanted. After further looking I found a really good deal on the Z740 so I had to buy it! I will say that I am impressed with the life of the battery that came with it. I still haven't had to change it and I have had the camera for about two months. I have used both the viewfinder and the LCD screen and I have taken lots of video and still no dead battery. After selling and using digital cameras for over 6 years, I will have to say that this is one of the best! The only thing better would be an slr digital,but I don't have the $1,000 or more to pay for one and although I would like to be, I am not a professional photographer, so this one is perfect. Also, as an added note.. When I sell to customers that have never used a digital before, I usually suggest a Kodak, I have found that   Kodak has the most user friendly cameras. Good Luck and I hope you find the perfect camera for you, I know I did!!!
