        GREAT CAMERA / GREAT VALUE, August 28, 2008
        ByR. Craig  - See all my reviews
For the money I don't believe this camera can be beat.  I could not be more satisfied with this camera.  I have already taken about three hundred pictures just learning and playing with all the features.  The picture quality is great. The photos I've taken look professional and this is quite an accomplishment since I have NEVER taken any good shots in my life. Easy mode produces great shots. Auto produces great shots. Now I'm exploring manual settings which I never thought I could do and am getting great shots.If you want a GREAT CAMERA for VERY LITTLE MONEY, then look no farther because this is that camera! So you don't throw money away I would recommend re-chargeable batteries and a battery charger.  Also spend a little time in the instruction manual if you are completely ignorant like I am about cameras, it will be time well spent and make your purchase more pleasurable.
