        Great little camera, get the aux flash unit., July 1, 2008
        ByP. Mazurowski "MacManMaz" (Tonawanda, NY)  - See all my reviews
Many reviews on the great aspects of the camera here, just one thing to add. The flash is OK for a point and shoot compact camera, but does take a few seconds to recharge between shots and uses batteries quickly. This is not unique to this camera and my guess is that it just takes power to make a good flash, no matter what camera you use. For those people that need better and faster flash performance, the add on flash unit is the trick. Save batteries and take better indoor flash pictures faster for around $90...http://www.amazon.com/Canon-HF-DC1-Powershot-Digital-Cameras/dp/B0007MGFI2/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8s=electronicsqid=1214926744sr=8-1
