        Great Camera for the price!, February 8, 2009
        ByGerald Eiting (Ohio)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera about a month ago, so I've had a little time to use it and found it to be a great camera.  It's a good mix of being both a simple "point-and-shoot" camera or allowing great control in manual modes for special effect pictures.  I don't consider myself to be a good photographer, yet the pictures I get with this camera are great.  I've had a couple of digital cameras, but this one blows them away.  Several features I like are that it uses SD or the newer SDHC cards, standard or NmHI AA batteries, has an optical viewfinder (great for us over 40 people).  While it comes with a good deal of documentation, using this camera without reading too much of that is easy.  The onscreen menus are easy to navigate.  To be honest, I can't think of a bad thing to say about this camera.  Well, one thing is they give you a 32 meg SD card with it, which is pretty useless as an 8 mega pixel super fine picture will consume close to 4 megabytes of memory...  Personally I would recommend at least a 512 meg card, also, get good NmHI rechargeable batteries and charger.
