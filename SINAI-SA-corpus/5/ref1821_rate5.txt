        Rock Solid, October 5, 2007
        ByNakuru (New Jersey, USA)  - See all my reviews
I'll make this short. The camera feels rock solid. This is not your beginner camera - unless you want to really LEARN PHOTOGRAPHY!I've owned other Pentax products alongside Nikon. I'm a big Nikon fan but thought I'd give this cam a chance - plus it accepts all Pentax lenses manufactured since the Middle Ages!If you intend to buy this camera with a zoom, I'd probably consider something else than the Pentax 'kit zoom' it's typically sold with. Spend the extra bucks on a Tamron 18-250 and you'll be covered. The kit lens is 'just ok' but somewhat limited in range and seems destined to collect dust once you've played with it a few weeks.Size-wise this fits big hands and is not a lightweight - just as 'serious cameras' are supposed to be.Again, 'rock solid' would be my description and this camera's biggest impression out of the box. Great job Pentax. Now all I've gotta do is go shoot!
