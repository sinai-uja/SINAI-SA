 I love this camera! It was our first digital and I did my share of research before buying it online for christmas last year. Boy am I glad we chose this puppy she really couldn't take a bad picture if she wanted to! Its always crisp clean and beautiful. I would recommend this camera to anyone I know or meet looking to invest in  the best camera they can get for [...]or less.
