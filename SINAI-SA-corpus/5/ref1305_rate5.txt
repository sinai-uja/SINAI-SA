        Easy to Use, Beautiful Photos, Good Movies, June 21, 2007

This is my favorite camera.  I used it constantly for a year and then upgraded last fall to the 7 mega pixel version of it.  Now my kids use this one.  They love it, too.  It's easy enough to use that my 5 year old can even use it!  I like the burst mode that lets me take 3 photos quickly in a row.  I like that I can mount it to my tripod.  I'm not an advanced enough user to need alot of the special features it offers, but I enjoy the action and portrait modes.  I especially like the hard lens cover that protects it.  The cameras that just have a self-closing lens cover never work for me because the cover can be pushed open easily and then the lens gets scratched.  I need a camera like this one that can get banged around in the car.  I dropped it off the kitchen counter the other day and it still works fine.  It's a good sturdy camera and the prints come out beautiful.
