I did alot of checking before I decided on the Canon PowerShot A590IS.  I'm glad I did, this camera is just what I wanted.  Takes great pictures, very clear, very sharp.  Faces and background.. perfect.  I took some shots of the sun setting, even to my eye it seemed so very far away, but it came out so great.  I seen some ppl thought it was chunky or heavy, Not so at least not to me.  All and all.. great camera, btw.. can't beat the price or dealing with Amazon.  Not the first time I bought from Amazon and won't be the last.  At least I know of one store I won't be disappointed with.
