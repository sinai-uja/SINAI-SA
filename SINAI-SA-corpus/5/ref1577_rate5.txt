        Great camera!, October 30, 2008
        ByR. Lee  - See all my reviews
Took camera on a month long trip to Central and South America and it performed wonderfully.  I used it many times under water and the pictures came out really good.  I also "bumped" it a few times and since it is shock-proof, no harm done.  Highly recommend it.
