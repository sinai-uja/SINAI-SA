This is a serious little camera for very little money.  This has to be one of the finest cameras that I have ever owned.  It is versatile, relatively light-weight, and can store a lot of photos.  The only down-side that I see is that it uses batteries, instead of a rechargeable battery.  However, that down-side is easily handled with rechargeable AA batteries.
