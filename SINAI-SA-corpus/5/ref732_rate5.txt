I purchased this camera because it has something to stabilize the pictures I want to take.  It does SO much more.  The pictures are really sharp to my eyes at least and the movies with sound are great.  The battery life is not that bad and extra batteries are really cheap on ebay.  It is really easy to carry and easy to use.  A very good value.
