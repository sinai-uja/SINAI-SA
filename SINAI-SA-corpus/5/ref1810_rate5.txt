        A photographer's camera, December 26, 2007

The Pentax K 10d is the winner in DSLR cameras aimed for amateur photographers looking for quality equipment at less than $1000.  Pentax has hit the sweet spot with the K10d offering features found in cameras costing more than $1000.  Since I have a Nikon N80, it's the film version of the D80,I seriously considered the D80.  But even with my Nikon lenses I still saved over $200 with the Pentax plus I don't have to spend extra for the Nikon imaging program for RAW files. The D80 doesn't have a sensor cleaner or shake reduction built into the camera body. I have been using the Pentax for about a month and find that it's a photographers camera.  Controls that you use for taking pictures are dials on the camera body not menus. You can look through the viewfinder to make changes and not have to stop and scroll through a menu found on other brands.  I would also recommend buying the Pentax AF360 or 540 flash. The competition among camera companies is fierce and the consumer is in the drivers seat. You really can't go wrong with any DSLR. I looked at other brands besides Nikon.  Cannon and Sony make great cameras but you really have to put the camera in your hand, take pictures and see which camera is comfortable for you. It should be an extension of your eye and you should be able to work the controls intutively.
