        Most of the usefulness of a DSLR in a pocket-sized package., January 11, 2008

Well, if you have big pockets. It's pretty clunky for a point-and-shoot, but the zoom and manual mode make up for it. It's small enough to lug around, yet the grip and features make it feel like a "real" camera. The all-manual exposure mode was my main reason for buying Canon A-series cameras, even though I've ended up using them in Program mode 99% of the time -- it's a very smart P. mode. Neither this one nor the previous A70 have disappointed me in any way (other than the A70's CMOS coming loose, but that's a warranty repair, I just chose to buy a new 8MP instead of getting the old one fixed).The AiAF seems to alway pick the wrong part of the frame to focus on for me, but I turned it off and just used the center frame and a half-press of the shutter button. No problem with that method, since I grew up on Olympus OM-series SLRs.The manual focusing leaves something to be desired, since it just gives a magnified center on the LCD, and no cheats -- you have to judge sharpness on the little LCD, by eyeballing it. But you'll never need to use the MF, since the auto works perfectly from one inch to infinity if you set it to only use the center zone, then focus on what you want to be sharp and hold the shutter button halfway down while you compose. The MF does show a distance scale at the top, so you can really fine-tune it if you're willing to break out a ruler.Overall, I'd say it's as good as you can get without interchangeable lenses. Ease of use and features abound.
