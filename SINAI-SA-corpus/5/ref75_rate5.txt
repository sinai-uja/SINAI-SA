        Canon knows how to create a value, January 19, 2009

This is the third Canon digital camera I have bought and they seem to improve each time. The camera is simple to use, though the "easy" feature is really more of a gimmick than added value, the unit as a whole is extremely easy to set up and use. Graet photos and easy interface with a PC for editing and reviews. Haven't tried the digital video feature yet, but that is next. I would recommend the Canon 500 series over more expensive Panasonic and Sony cameras I have owned, which will now be retired.
