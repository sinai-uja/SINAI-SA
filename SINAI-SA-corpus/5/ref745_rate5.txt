        ByMinnie (Dumont, N.J.)  - See all my reviews
I am not up on all the technical things about photography so I have not made many changes to this, except some I read from other reviewers. I don't even understand some of the instructions. But I do know what I expect a good picture to look like and this camera has not let me down. The pictures I have taken, small objects, sunsets, lightning, and people have come out great. If I want I can always edit them on the computer. The program  they give you to use  is so easy. I highly recommend this to even the once in awhile picture takers.
