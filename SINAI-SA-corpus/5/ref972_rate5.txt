        Great Point and Shoot Camera, January 7, 2009
        ByGerardo A. Guerra  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera as a replacement for my Panasonic one after reading great reviews and being on top of most products reviews.  It is definitively as good as the reviews promised.8.3 megapixels with optical image stabilization. It can detect up to 9 faces in a scene and use them to set exposure and focus. It also uses face detection to remove red-eye automatically and to calculate white balance for better skin tones (that said some night indoor images seem too orange/yellow, but it gets corrected if you select night mode). The Motion Detection Technology also uses face detection if the subject is moving and adjusts settings to prevent motion blur.The lens (38-114mm f/2.8-4.9) is not as wide as the 870's  (28-105mm f/2.8-5.8), nor its viewfinder (2.5-inch LCD) as large (3-inch LCD), but is definitively sleeker, more technologically advanced (the 870 does not have the face detection features) and cheaper!
