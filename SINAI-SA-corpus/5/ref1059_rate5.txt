        Great Camera for Making Video Clips, August 29, 2008
        ByAnon, Arlington, VA  - See all my reviews
I have no idea why this is the case, but the picture quality on the video clips I make of my baby using this camera are better/sharper/clearer than the HD-Canon Vixia and other High-Def. cameras (such as the Pentax)...confusing since a lot of other cameras I've tried have either similar or even better specifications, so I was very surprised to find this to be the case.  Anyways, I'm really, really, glad I found this camera.  I just love it!  I have a Nikon D40 for most of my pictures of the baby, but this is the compact camera I keep in my purse with me at all times--and it is perfect for me.
