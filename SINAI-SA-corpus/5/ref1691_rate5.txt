I researched all the point and shoot cameras and found the Olympus Stylus 1030SW has the most to offer for the money. Besides the obvious features no other cameras can match like the Water Proof, Crush proof and so on is the overall quality of the camera. It looks and feels very well made. The pictures are sharp and clear and the menu and buttons are easy to understand and operate. One of the truely best point and shoot cameras out there.
