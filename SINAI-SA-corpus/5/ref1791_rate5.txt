Pentax K10D 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with Shake Reduction (Body Only)This is a terrific camera, packed with more features than you can imagine. I have always used Pentax cameras and this one lives up to the hype. First of all, all Pentax lenses ever made can be used with the K10D. that was a real positive for me. It is well made and feels solid in your hands. The battery life is amazingly long and you can take about 400+ pictures before a charge.   It is not a beginners camera however. The software is ok, but beleive it or not,I prefer the proprietary i photo software that comes with a MAC; it's just easier to use. There is a lot of camera here for the money and I give it a full 5 stars. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
