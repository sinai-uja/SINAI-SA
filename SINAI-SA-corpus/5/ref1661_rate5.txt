Bought this product before our trip to Jamaica, mon.  Tried it out in the pool before leaving and it worked great.  Took it on our trip and got great pictures, with one caveat.  Make sure you're using the right setting.  If the colors don't look right on the screen, you're probably taking above water pictures using the underwater setting.In clear water, underwater pictures are outstanding.  In murky water, your underwater pictures are murky.I wish it had a 10X optical zoom.
