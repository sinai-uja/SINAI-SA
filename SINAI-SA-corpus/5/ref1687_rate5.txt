        Love this camera! Lost it, buying a new one!, September 12, 2008

Hands down, this camera is fantastic.I've taken it under water, through the worlds largest tomato fight in Spain, and all over the place. It can go through anything. It also has a picture mode for just about anything you can think of, and takes good pictures.I'm an outdoor enthusiast, and this camera is fantastic in almost every way. I love that I don't have to worry about where I take this camera, whether I get it dirty, or anything else - it just simply works. I love that.Ok, now the bad stuff. Really this camera should get a rating of 4.8, because it lacks in a couple of areas.1) You can't charge it from a USB source, so if you're going on a long trip, you're going to have to buy lots of extra batteries - bummer! And I'm terribly annoyed that they did this.2) It doesn't turn pictures right side up for you automatically. My friends $140 camera does this for her, and mine does not. It makes me cry every time she pulls out her cheapie.But, those two deficiencies shouldn't be enough to draw you away from this camera. This thing is bullet proof, works in any environment, and "Just works!" period.I think they added those two deficiencies just because it would be unfair to the other camera companies if they actually produced a completely perfect camera, no one would want any other one, we would loose competition, and ultimately monopolies are bad for the consumer anyway.Cheers
