        nice product, May 27, 2008
        Bynate  - See all my reviews
camera is simple, but has plenty of options for more advanced users. takes really nice pictures on auto mode, and doesn't eat up batteries as fast as i thought it would. is a little bulky (awkward to carry around in your pocket), but otherwise perfect. nice price too
