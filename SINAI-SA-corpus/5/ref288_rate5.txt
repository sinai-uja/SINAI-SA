We received this camera, as promised, two days before taking a family winter vacation to Disneyland for four days after Christmas. We took a lot of shots there, of ourselves and of the many wonderful sights.  This camera is user-friendly, takes very clear images, and captured the lights and fireworks at night surprisingly well. It was a good Christmas present to ourselves!
