        Pentax rewrote their playbook and delivered , January 9, 2007
        ByC. A. Buhlmann (Portland Oregon)  - See all my reviews
I have only owned or used Pentax cameras for the past 23 years From P-3, to SF-10 to PZ-1, 645 and then the ist D and have been published with everyone of them.   I know the K10D is taking my photography to a new level.  This camera deserves the pro grade label vs the "advanced amateur" label of prior products by the photography elite.  Having shot near 500 frames since this month, I am very impressed with the AWB accuracy and the antishake.  I shoot alot of manual focus macro and recently was late day on the backside of Mt Hood and could shoot snow crystals hand held at 1/25th of a second without a tripod.  Could never do that with any other camera.   They claim 3 frames a second, but I clocked mine at 4 frames per which is plenty fast.  One other item is the extended autobracketing to a total of 5 frames.  Though I need to work with this more, I am very impressed with the ability to also bracket on white balance.  Gone are the days of filters, now you can add the equivalent of the old 81B warming filter within the same sequence of shots. I still need to add the vertical grip, to give better vertical control but this camera is quickly become a value added enabler to my creativity.  The amount of control I can exercise is pro level, yet if you are a first time buyer, the program function user interface will enable anyone to take great shots right out of the box.  Firmware is stable and I have not had a single issue with this product.  Well done Pentax!
