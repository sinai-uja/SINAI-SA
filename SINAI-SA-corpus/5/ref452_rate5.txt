        I love this camera!!, July 9, 2007
        Bypatdra "patdra" (Litchfield, Minnesota United States)  - See all my reviews
This is my favorite camera....what holds it above all the others is the moveable LCD screen.  I bought a 2GB SD card for it and at the best settings it holds up to 567 photos and the video perfect!
