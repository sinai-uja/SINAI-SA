        A nice little camera, December 16, 2008
        ByPatricia E. Kimball "A Kevin Harvick fan..." (Whitesboro,NY (central NY)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera to replace my broken (one too many drops on the floor) Sony Cybershot after reading the reviews on it and those within the same price range.The Sony Cybershot took great pictures and the Canon Powershot matches up pretty well but you need to know the ins and outs of the manual settings  in order to take non-blury pictures without using the auto features.For it's price this is a nice deal and a sharp looking camera.Pictures look better once downloaded or printed...the view screen does not do them a great justice.I have not yet learned all of this cameras features and best photo taking options(given the circumstances).
