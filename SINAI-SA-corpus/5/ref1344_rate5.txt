        The Kodak camera that loved the UK, November 14, 2005
        ByH. M. Gillis "beamerdog" (Connecticut)  - See all my reviews
What that title means, is that the camera stayed behind in Edinburgh, Scotland as my husband and I caught our flight home. But we are getting it back.The review I would write is that the camera is very easy to use. We loved using it for our two weeks in the U.K. We just happened to leave it behind. We found the camera to have some unique and wonderful features, such as the camera adjusted the picture when it was used sideways. A great camera for travel. I can't wait to have it back!!!!!
