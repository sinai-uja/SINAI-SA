Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Brown)I own and am a huge fan of the Canon Digital Rebel SLR and think that it takes great pictures.  Unfortunately, there are times when a larger camera with all of it's accessories and lenses can be prohibitive.  In preparation for an upcomming event where I would be a participant as well as spectator, I realized that I would be unable to carry around my Rebel.  So, I spent several days reading different reviews before deciding on the Canon PowerShot SD 1100.  I must stress that the fact that I already owned a Canon played no part in my decision.  I did not settle on the SD 1100 out of brand loyalty.  I must have read more than 30 or 40 different "professional" reviews of various cameras before picking this one.I have only had this camera for a couple of days, and haven't yet used it at the event for which it was purchased, but I must say that I am extremely pleased with this camera.  The most common negative comment in reviews of this camera is that it does not offer a wide variety of manual settings.  I have to agree that if you are looking for a camera to launch your career as a professional photographer, this may not be the best choice for you.  The camera is ultra compact without feeling cheap.  It is well designed, well made, full featured, takes great photos under a variety of conditions and exceeds all of my expectations for a more "portable" alternative to my full sized SLR.  I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about this camera and I cannot imagine why somebody wouldn't be extremely happy with this purchase.I also recommend buying the case advertised as an accessory for this model as it has a belt loop that allows you to carry it safely and securely on your belt instead of in your pocket.
