        Another wonderful Canon camera, March 4, 2007
        ByAnon  - See all my reviews
This is my third camera in the A-series.  Like its preceders, it takes crisp and clear pictures full of vibrant colors.  I absolutely love the Color Accent feature, to turn all but one color black  it's high-resolution, too, so it doesn't appear grainy on the screen.  My friend Nathan has a 3" screen as well, but his has low-resolution and everything always looks grainy/blurry.One final neat feature of the A630 is it being motion-sensitive.  When viewing pictures, you can turn the camera 90º and view vertical images vertically on the screen.  If you try to view vertical images horizontally, you don't get a very good idea of how it turned out.All in all, this camera takes GREAT pictures and has neat effects, but is simple enough for an amateur to use.
