I've had this camera for about a year now, and I love it.It's my first digital and I'm amazed at all it can do. It has all the features I could ever want. I just take photos of family get-togethers.After a few months I discovered how to take videos and they are a lark! I paid around $170 for it a year ago and it's a great camera for that price.
