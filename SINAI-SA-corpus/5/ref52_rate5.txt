        I love it!, February 5, 2009

I absolutely love my new camera!  It is more beautiful in hand, than in the photos, which was a plus for me because it is more silver looking than black, which was what I really wanted.  The colors are incredible, which was not a surprise as I really searched for a camera with high resolution photos.  Too good, as it does tend to make something not clean look gorgeous!  Easy to handle, use, transfer photos to computer (don't need to buy anything more, just need a USB port on your computer).  Need a decent 4GB SDHC memory card (try San Disk on Amazon for $4); one is included but very small memory, batteries also included, and don't even think to get a recharger (not necessary). Price is unbeatable for the value!  Snatch this up, you won't be sorry!
