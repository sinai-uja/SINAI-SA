I am NOT a electronics person, so when this camera was recommended by several people, I thought, ok..BUT was I surprised!!! It is so easy to use and it doesnt make me "electro phobic". Snap and shoot or if you are electronically inclined, you have a lot of cool features to use and enjoy!Manuel isnt for me, but if you can do it, so can this camera. I would definitely recommend.
