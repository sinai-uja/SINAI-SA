Bought this camera from Amazon in April, 2004.  Had used only 35mm SLR's before--this was my first digital and was highly recommended by a friend.  For the price (I did get the $150 rebate) I think it is EXCELLENT after using it for 4 months.  And I haven't begun to use many of the advanced things it will do.
