I'm an amateur photographer and I've always used point and shoots until I decided to drop some money into a nice DSLR. I did a lot of research and thought I found a Nikon that I wanted until I visited a new camera store in my area. The clerk there introduced me to he K200D. I didn't believe in this camera I never heard of but I went home and compared it to the rest. The K200D has everything I wanted and then some. The main sell point for me was the fact that in camera lab testing, the K200D came out sharper than a Nikon, Canon, or Olympus cameras is was up against. I decided that this is the camera I wanted. After the purchase, I've loved everything about it. I am very satisfied. The ONLY problem I have with it is the shutter is loud. If your trying to shoot a wedding or an event with a person speaking, the shutter is so obnoxiously loud that you might as well yell *CLICK* every time you compose a shot. (watch reviews on you tube and you can hear it) Overall, I am very impressed with it's picture quality, build quality, and it's features. The K200D is the perfect camera for a starter and semi-pro photographer. Also, a small bonus (another win for me) is you can say you don't have the same Nikon or Canon camera that almost EVERYONE else has.
