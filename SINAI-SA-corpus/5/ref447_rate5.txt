I bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it. I bought myself a Sony digital over a year ago and it is amazing the difference in technology in that short a time. I almost kept the Canon and gave her my Sony, but I didn't. I was impressed with the quality and the speed of taking pictures and pleased that the prices have come down since I purchased mine. Great Buy.
