I bought this camera after losing my last one, which was just terrible. Grass is always greener, I suppose.  I really love this one, with the image stabilization, and its size being so convenient for keeping in my pocket.  I also love that it has a lens through which you can see what you're taking a picture of, if it's too bright for the LCD.
