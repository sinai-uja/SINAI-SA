        Great Camera for Beginners, November 28, 2004

I have recently become interested in digital photography. This camera is great for people who are starting out a photography hobby, or want a simple camera to use. The camera has a lot of features, but is still easy to use. By setting it on "auto" the camera does all the work for you. But you still have a lot of options. You can change the flash setting, white balance, ISO speed, etc all in an easy to navigate menu. The pictures look great. While there might be digital cameras out there that take better pictures, none are as cheap and have as many features. The Easyshare software that comes with the camera is the only thing that is lacking. It makes it easy to e-mail your pictures (which is what it is designed for, I suppose) and simple editing techniques are also available. But there is no option for more advanced editing, even resizing a picture is not available. It is also difficult to organize the pictures in their respective folders, you are forced to do it within the program if you want to continue to access them in the easyshare program. Despite this downfall, I think this camera is a great buy, and would recommend it to anyone.
