        Not as fast as I would like but good..., August 23, 2007

Much faster than similar cameras made 3 years ago... but still was hoping for faster shots.  Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but it takes a second to capture a photo. Otherwise, very happy.  I love the way the view screen flips around (and ends up right-side-up!) so my baby sees himself when I take his photo (I see him through the window)... Moms know: nothing's more exciting than your baby seeing himself (or the "other" baby).
