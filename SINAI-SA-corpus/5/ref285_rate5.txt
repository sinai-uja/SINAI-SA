        Awsome Camera for the money, January 13, 2009
        BypsiEnergos "psiEnergos" (Arizona)  - See all my reviews
I was already sold on the PowerShot as I already own another one.  This one is a little smaller than the PowerShot A620 (7.1 Mpx model), but every bit as good.  The only thing I missed is the closing viewer, but for one third the price of the A620 (When I bought it 3 yrs ago), I can deal without it.  The vendor was awesome too!  Product delivered in very short time.
