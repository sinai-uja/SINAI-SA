        Terrific DSLR camera!, December 11, 2007
        ByPentaxUser  - See all my reviews
This is my first SLR camera and i'm in awe by the image quality this camera produces.  Very easy to learn with plenty of features to keep me busy for some time before I upgrade.  I definitely recommend this camera to any photographer looking for a solid built camera at an affordable price.  Only issue I foresee is the 100$ rebate as it seems the company responsible for the rebates aren't processing them in a timely manner.
