        Great camera for the price!, February 20, 2009

We purchased this camera for my nine year old as a Christmas gift.  And we have yet to be disappointed with it!  She is careful with it, but has dropped it a couple of times on a carpeted floor.  It is still working great! It only took her a couple of hours of playing with it to figure out all the settings on it and she has been able to take some amazing pictures with it.When we purchased this camera, we didn't know it also shoots videos!  So, I do recommend getting a very large memory card for it.  Fortunately we got the 4gb memory card (Sandisk brand--cost us about $10).  500 pictures and 10 videos of varying length later and she has yet to use up the 4gb!I highly recommend this camera to anyone who desires a great digital camera for an excellent price!
