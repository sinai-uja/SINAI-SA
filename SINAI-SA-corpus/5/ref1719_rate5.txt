This camera is versatile, easy to use and takes great pictures.  Although I have not tried the underwater movie mode yet, I look forward to doing that this summer.  Its heavy-duty design takes the worry out of the camera being knocked about.  I ordered the strap with the carabiner-type clip for easier attachment to a backpack or belt.  This camera, so far, seems to be worth the money.
