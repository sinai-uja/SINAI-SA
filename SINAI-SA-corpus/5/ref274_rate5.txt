        Even Grandma is pleased..., January 22, 2009
        Bysomnial "somnial" (Hotlanta)  - See all my reviews
This was a Christmas present for a 75 year-old Grandma...one who, up to this point, bought only disposable cameras.  After a 10 minute lesson on uses and the basic mechanics, she is now a photo fiend - pictures of every moment and every event since the gift was given.  The ease of use plays biggest into the equation, there really wasn't a learning curve (though the explanation of the SD card got a little murky).  Nonetheless, CVS develops them for her and they erase the old ones; she is set after each shoot - she loves it.  Color and accuracy of the images is more than passable, down-right nice!
