        Most bang for the buck for this type of camera, February 12, 2009

inexpensive and easy to use-takes great pictures. Unlike other cameras in this category-you can buy an adapter and add accessories like super wide angle or telephoto lens-polarizer-trick filters etc.  Getting it from Amazon was a breeze-super fast free shipping.I'm very pleased with the transaction and the product.
