I was very worried about purchasing a new digital camera. I wanted to make sure it was a quality product and that most importantly, the pictures were of high quality. I looked at so many different brands, Fuji, Cannon, Nikon, Olympus; and everytime, I came back to the Kodak. My previous camera was a Kodak and I still have it and still use it on occasion. This camera is truly amazing. All the different settings that you have to choose from are GREAT and they are so simply, my 8 year old niece can use it. If you get this camera, you will not be disappointed.The important features that I was really looking for were:Picture QualityVideo CapabilitiesEasy to use Optional FlashPortabilityThose were the ones that I wanted in my future camera and I definitely found them in this one. The video feature is even better than my previous camera and this model has a playback with the audio! Which was exciting for me. I would recommend this camera to my friends and family highly!!
