The A590IS is the 8-MP sibling of the 7-Megapixel 570IS.  I've played with both, and at an almost equal price, the 590 is the way to go.- "Automatic" mode makes it easy as pie for point-and-shoot.  Photo novices will find the Automatic -- and above that, Easy -- modes a welcome way to "just take the picture already!".  The auto-focus, facial recognition, and adjustment features all respond quickly at half-depress... lining up a great shot is simple and quick.- "Manual" mode gives you reign over everything about the photo, from the white balance, to the aperture, flash output, and even the part of the screen it uses to calculate gamma compensation.  When you've got time to make the picture turn out just right, this little camera won't disappoint.- The lens isn't half bad either, giving you focus-adjustment down to 2 inches from the end of the lens, and incremental up to 10 feet.As with most new Digital Cameras, the viewfinder has been long-since replaced by the back LCD, which provides a helpful and adjustable HUD.  The color spectral graphs are especially nice to have on-hand if you're worried about balancing multiple shots against each other.The only cons are inherent in the design:  the viewfinder and flash are almost useless when the camera is fitted with an optional lens hood / adapter.  The buttons and dial adjustments are also small, so it pays to familiarize yourself with the user interface.All in all, a fantastic camera for the price.  Image stabilization, a 4x zoom, optional attachments, and a trim pricetag make this a great deal for anyone looking to upgrade to a non-SLR picture snapper.
