        Excellent build.  Great pics, September 2, 2008

This is my 1st DSLR, 6th digital camera.I selected the camera for it's features, and construction.It had to have body stabilization, and sensor cleaning.  The useof AA's, and very good battery life, are a definite plus.Pentax did an excellent job of sealing off the body from moisture, as proven on Kauai, when it and my family and friend were drenched on the Kalalau trail.   The ergonomics seem to be very good.  The grip and feel are rock solid, and feel balanced with either the 18-55mm AL2 or the 55-300mm zooms.  The built in flash performs remarkably well, and the low light sensitivity  works well, even with the apertures I have on the zooms.  The AA's I have been using were the Sanyo Eneloops, and even with only a 2000mah rating, they lasted the whole day,good enough to fill a 2GB card, which also included a handful of flash/flash assisted pics.  The new low discharge Eneloops can sit in the camera for weeks, then be called on for duty without worry...something only the Lithium ion folks could brag about before.   The negatives?  The white balance should be on it's own (but the Fn button gets you there quickly, too). The clack of the shutter/mirror assembly is noticeable in a quiet surrounding.
