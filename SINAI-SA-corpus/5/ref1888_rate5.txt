        Just got this camera Last week, so still learning!, May 19, 2008
        ByJames C. Welch III "Jensen80" (The ATL)  - See all my reviews
I just baught this camera last week, after reaching the limit of where I felt I could grow with a point and shoot cam. I wanted to move into the more versital world of DSLR. So far so good. I have had good luck with this camera, as stated in other reviews it does have a tendecy to be off a little on color, but not enough you notice when printing out pic. I find the menus easy to use, and the camera fits into your hands well. I am a big guy 6+ with large hands and I foun. the Cannon and Olympus Cams to small for my hands (on the flip side, my wife is a petit woman and finds this camera a little big)I have been using this for a week or two so far in conjuction with Corel® Paint Shop Pro® Photo X2 and I have been able to create some great orginal images. Pros: - Sharp, crip images - Quick Auto Focus - Easy MenusCons: - Bit of a learning cureve from a point and shoot (To be expected since you want the extra versotility, but it takes time to master) - Colors are a little off, but not enough to distract from this picture.Please read the full review for this cam on DP Review.
