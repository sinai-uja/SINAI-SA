        K200D for Landscape Pictures, October 31, 2008
        ByBig Pecan "dSLR newbe" (Louisiana)  - See all my reviews
I recently purchased the Pentax K200D with the 18-55mm lens after much comparison of all the popular entry level dSLRs. I chose the Pentax based on actually "feeling" the camera at a local camera store. It was comfortable and feels very well built. I used the camera on a recent trip to the Smoky Mountains and took many picts in automatic  with the bracketing mode turned on. The pictures were fantastic. I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting to make the leap from "point and shoot" to dSLRs and wants a bit more than most entry level cameras and the weather resistent well built camera body. This camera really met all my expectations and then some.
