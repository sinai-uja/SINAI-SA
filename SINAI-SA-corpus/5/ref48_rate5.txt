        Fun Camera, February 7, 2009

I have bought two of these, one each for my daughter and daughter-in-law.They are tough little cameras that take lovely pictures. They can be adjusted a bit if you are into that and the video function as been huge entertainment. Compact enough for cargo pockets and purses, big enough to hold on to. A little zoom lens and a built in flash make it versitile. Uses rechargable AA's and a common memory card (SD) making it practical. All in an affordable package. It is not a DSLR, but it will be there and be able to get a nice shot.
