        A Kid's Review
This was my second digital camera. If you want a fancy camera with amazing shots, this isn't for you, but it's a fun, small, (relatively) cheap point-and-shoot camera with some great features. I love taking pictures on it.If you're thinking about buying it and you just want a nice, easy-to-use camera, this is for you. Thank you, Canon.
