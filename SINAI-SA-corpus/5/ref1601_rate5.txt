        Bysocalmal "socalmal" (SoCAL)  - See all my reviews
Looking for a durable camera for your thru-hike?  You've found it.  You can't find another camera with comparable features, this has everything you need to make it from Mexico to Canada and then some.  Make the right choice and get the one that will make it all the way with some really adverse conditions to go through and keep on working.  You don't want to miss any shots or worry about that last river crossing so get the camera that will get the job done and very well at that.
