Camera is excellent.  Pictures are some of the best I have ever taken.  The printer dock, though I feel is a little fragile, makes great pictures with superb colors.In addition I would be remiss if I did state that this package orignally came damaged and Amazon replaced all but overnight.  I am not accustomed to such outstanding customer service.
