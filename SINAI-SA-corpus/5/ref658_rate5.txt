I'm actually excited about this camera because I could figure it out and take pictures right away.  I will say that the battery compartment is a joke and I might end up breaking it at some point, but the battery life is good, so I don't have to risk it very often!  This camera is bigger than most other newer cameras; however, it's by no means bulky or huge and fits into my purse just fine.  I like that there is somewhere to grip and the LCD comes out and flips around to really see what I'm shooting.  The zoom is awesome as well.  I'm amazed at how far technology has come since my last camera.  This is an 8 mega pixel camera with great zoom in a great size for a great price!
