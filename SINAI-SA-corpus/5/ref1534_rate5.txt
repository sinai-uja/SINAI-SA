Can't find anything wrong with this camera. Takes great pictures, when you read the manual and understand its functions this camera is very user friendly. Fits comfortly in the hand when taking pictures. There are great extras that can be bought for this camera, external battery pack which holds six AA batteries which gives me hours of picture taking. I Love This Camera.
