        what I was looking for, February 19, 2009

I was looking for another canon camera with at least  8 meg. pix. with Image Stabilization, that uses AA batteries with the SD card. I have a larger Canon with these options but wanted a smaller version to take on vacation trips and the A590 fits the options that I was looking for, plus the price was a plus. This is my 3rd Canon and I have been very happy with all three cameras with a great deal of features included, plus excellent pictures.
