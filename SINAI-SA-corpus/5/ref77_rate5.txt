        A terrific camera!, January 19, 2009
        ByWarren E. Miller (Prescott, Arizona)  - See all my reviews
I purchased the Canon PowerShot A590IS for my wife and she is relating easily to it. I wanted a compact camera that was not too tiny (tiny things get lost or misplaced too easily), an easy point-and-shoot camera, but capable of sophisticated manipulation by a photographer who wants more control. This is a good choice. The controls and functions are very intuitively organized; it was easy to use right out of the box. I like that it uses standard AA batteries so refreshing batteries is simple and quick (you can certainly use rechargable batteries and a separate charger, but you are not limited to proprietary batteries). There are many ways to download images from camera to computer. I recommend it for anyone who wants ease of use and versatility.
