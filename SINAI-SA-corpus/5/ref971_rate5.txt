        Great Point & Shoot Camera, January 7, 2009

This camera is a great point and shoot camera.  It is small, compact yet solid.  It takes great pictures with little effort and allows immediate feed back on each picture.  It has very little delay in the first shot or subsequent shots which was a significant issue with our first digital camera.
