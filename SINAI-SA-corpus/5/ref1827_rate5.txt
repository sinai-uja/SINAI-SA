        Best Purchase In Decades, January 19, 2008
        ByR. Martin "rormeister" (Seattle WA USA)  - See all my reviews
I won't belabor my review with all the superlatives already praising this amazing camera.  What I will tell you is if you are currently a Pentax film camera owner looking into getting into Digital SLR, then look no further. I personally have several M42 (thread mount manual) lenses which are in mint condition and work perfectly with my Spotmatic II film camera. BUT, they also work PERFECTLY with the K10D (using simple manual settings and an inexpensive K mount adapter).  So, for the price of a Digital SLR body, and affordable at that, I can start capturing hi-res digital images immediately.I could not be happier with my purchase, despite all the rumors about the pending K20D. I find it humorous that the 'semi-pros' can't be satisfied with this camera, after all it was the best thing that happened to them since sliced cheese (less than 2 years ago) ;)
