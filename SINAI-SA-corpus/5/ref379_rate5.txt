I have been hesitant to buy a camera this size for quite some time and I am glad i waited.  I bought it to take to a Dolphins /Pats football game and every one of my pictures came out GREAT...I did not have to earase a single picture (out of 200)..Its user friendly, perfect weight, no red eye,....I am glad I waited for this updated version.  I would highly recommend for anyone of any age...My 11 year old nephew uses it and love it too.  Look no further this is it.  The best part of all is the price.
