        great little camera for the road, August 31, 2008
        ByChristoph Geiss "ceg" (Hartford, CT)  - See all my reviews
This camera is very small and fits comfortably in ones hand. Small changes in the camera's body make it feel smaller than one of its earlier predecessors, the Powershot SD 600 even though the actual dimensions are pretty much the same.There is much to love about this camera, but the most important points are: its small size, robust metal body, decent picture quality and surprising array of functions, which let you shoot under a wide range of conditions and override (or fool) many of the automatic settings. To make the most of this camera you need to read the manual carefully because many cool features are deeply hidden.My only complaint is the use of a special rechargeable battery. I like to take my camera on extended trips and after a about 250 pictures I have to hunt for an AC outlet (with my other camera, a Powershot A710 IS, I just pop in two new AA's). That's when the (pretty cheap) optical viewfinder comes in handy.The image stabilizer is nice - the usefulness of the face detection algorithm is debatable, but its presence sure doesn't hurt.In summary, its a great point and shoot camera. I have it in my jacket pocket almost every day.
