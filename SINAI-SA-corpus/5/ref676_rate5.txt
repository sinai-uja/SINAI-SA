My wife and I purchased the A630 3 months ago after doing a decent amount of research, and we both love it. Almost every feature of this camera is great. Long battery life (4 AAs), Good-Sized LCD screen, 8MP provides high-quality photos and movies even at 16x zoom, fast shutter speed (no waiting 5 seconds for the camera to "reset" in between pictures), etc. One of the neatest features is the fold-out LCD screen. We have 2 small children (age 3 and 11 months). If you flip out the screen so that they can see themselves, you can get some good photos because they're focused on watching themselves on the screen!
