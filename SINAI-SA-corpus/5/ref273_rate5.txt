Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomI have two film cameras but wanted a point and shoot that would be easy to used for quick candids.  This camera fits the bill.  It is easy to use, has a lot of program choices and controls for the cost and takes very sharp pictures in every situation I have used it so far.
