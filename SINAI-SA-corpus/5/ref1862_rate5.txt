        Adding To The ***** Bandwagon, April 9, 2008
        ByWilliam B. Nelson "Shutterpuppy" (Dallas Texas)  - See all my reviews
Have only had this camera for two days and it's everything I've wanted in a DSLR and more. I also almost got the K10 but it doesn't use the readily available rechargeable AA batteries which I have plenty of. The 10mp sensor is more than enough to get great big sharp enlargements. The grip on the camera is fantastic, I can't see it ever slipping from your hands unless you rub them with motor oil. I'm coming from a long line   of Fuji bridgecams I've own, including the 18x zoom s8000 that I also bought off Amazon, the quality difference is like night and day and the price I got for the Pentax makes me wonder why I even bought the former in the first place. If you want to spend anywhere from $200 to $700 more for a DSLR, be my guest but in my opinion your wasting your money, get this this camera and use the money you'll save to get your spouse a nice Mother's/Father's day gift so you won't have to sleep on the sofa because your lame excuses why you spent so much on a camera. Oh..Shake Reduction works like a dream.
