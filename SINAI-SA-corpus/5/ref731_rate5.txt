I have been looking at this camera for over a year and trying to see if i can find something better or cuter. Finally I just sucked it up and bought it and I have not regretted it a day since! I love this camera and its features. It takes great photos! I still need to work out the darkness in inside areas so that it wouldn't happen but everything else is great! This is a great camera. Its compact and adorable. The Photos speak for themselves!
