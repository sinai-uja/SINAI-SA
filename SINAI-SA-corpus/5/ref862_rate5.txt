        Quick, easy, great pictures, June 7, 2008
        ByAlexander Verbeck  - See all my reviews
I decided to get the SD 1100, rather than the 1000 or 750 my friends have, and I'm glad I did. The image stabilization works well, and having the extra megapixels means my shots consistently look just a bit better than theirs. Further, the thing is so remarkably small that it comes with me almost everywhere. It boots up quickly, too, making it easier to get shots of animals or moving people. I didn't install the included software, so I can't comment on that, but I do appreciate that pictures import into Picasa just fine without it.
