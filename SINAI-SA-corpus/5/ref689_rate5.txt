My old 35mm camera quit. I had not had any experience with a digital camera. I looked at newspaper ads and checked the local stores to see if I could find a camera that would meet my needs. My son advised me to go to Amazon.com. I purchased a Canon PowerShot A630. I am very pleased with it. It is easy to use and does every thing I want in a camera.
