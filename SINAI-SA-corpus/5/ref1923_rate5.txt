I love this camera!  I bought received it for christmas after many hours research comparing it to the Canon Rebel XSi, Nikon D60, Olympus E-520 and the Pentax K2000.  After a month and several hundred shots I am more than sure that I made the right choice.  This camera offers so many great features and is much better than the Pentax K2000 which basically has a bunch of dumbed down features such as the reduction in the number of AF points.  The battery life is great too, the Energizer Lithium batteries last an incredibly long time, I'm still on my first set that they provided.  I highly recommend this camera.
