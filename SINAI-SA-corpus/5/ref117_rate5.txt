Don't you just love it when you spend the time to shop around and really go after something that does what you want and you find it? at a great price??  I love this camera!!  I just recently purchased it so I have a long way to go on trying all the settings and options this camera offers... BUT! so far I am very much "wowed". The ability to "play" with the settings and experiment was what drew me to photography when I was younger. Those options, the versitility that goes with 8MP, along with ability to change lenses (I got the 3.2x telephoto and .45x wide angle) plus filters? It's what drew me to this camera and setup.  Real easy to use and I've already gotten compliments on the photos I've taken.  And when they do mention the pics they get an earful of praise directed to the reason the photos are so good with a quick demonstration of my new toy! ;)  Love that nice big crystal clear LCD!! and easy to read and understand menu. With a brand new grand daughter I will be trying real hard to wear the buttons off this one! :P  Did the research and I found a real winner.and the price! 5 stars, 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up! Sweet little camera with big results! Can't be beat IMO! Did I mention I love this camera?
