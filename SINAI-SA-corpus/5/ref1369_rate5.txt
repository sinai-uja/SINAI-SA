        ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER, May 13, 2005
        ByK.J.  - See all my reviews
I purchased this camera as desperately needed upgrade from my HP 812xi digital camera.  After over 2 months of research I decided that Kodak was my best bet as an upgrade and MAN OHH MAN am I pleased! When viewed from the camera display, the pictures look good, but when actually downloaded to a computer or printed they look fabulous.  I especially like the fact that the movie mode allows me to film quite a bit of footage and the battery that accompanied the camera is very strong.  I was able to purchase three rechargeable back-up batteries on Ebay for $5.00 each.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA!
