        Great dSLR, lots of features, December 10, 2006
        ByDoug Milligan (Colorado)  - See all my reviews
I spent weeks doing research into what "prosumer" dSLR I was going to purchase this year, and this one definately came out on top.  It is solidly built, and takes remarkable photos.  I bought the body through Amazon, along with a Tamron 17-35mm DI lens, and a 75-200mm DI lens.  Even with a 28-80 Pentax lens that was from a film SLR, the photos come out great.Pros:-  Incredible image quality, even at ISO's of 800 or more.-  Solid body.  Feels like it will last longer then the others I looked at such as the N80 and D20.-  The shake reduction is an added plus.  There is not need to spend extra $$ to get this feature in lenses.Cons:-  Selection of lenses is limited.  Tamron and Sigma have limited availability of Pentax mounts.-  A bit bulkier then expected.  None of the photo shops around me had the K10D in stock, but it was described as being about the same size and weight as the K100D's that they had to play with.  The K10D is a bit heavier, and the form is a bit different from the predecessor.-  I read in another review on a photo site that there is a thud heard when you move the camera side to side while it is off.  Mine does the same thing.  I now know that it's the orientation sensor.
