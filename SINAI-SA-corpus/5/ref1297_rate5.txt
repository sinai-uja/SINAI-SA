I love this camera.  It is the second digital camera I have owned by Kodak and like the first one, never had one regret.  I bought this camera for several reasons:1. PRICE2. SIZE3. LOOKSIt looks like a professional at first glance...and sure does take professional style photographs.  Many of my friends, who are professional photographers were SUPRISED when I told them what I was shooting with.  Don't get me wrong, I will upgrade to a digital SLR soon.The only thing that is a little annoying about the camera is that the lens cap doesn't stay on-AT ALL!  Putting the camera in the case knocks it off, taking the camera out of the case knocks it off.  TOUCHING the camera knocks it off.  But if I had to choose to get this camera again, I'd get it.  The zoom is amazing!  You can get so close.  Check out some of my photos taken with this amazing camera.www.lelalynch.comwww.myspace.com/ll_photography
