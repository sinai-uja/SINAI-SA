        Great for backpacking, January 28, 2009

I love this camera.    I bought it from Amazon with the kit lens, and I bought a used lens from B&H.   The great thing about Pentax is that they put image stabilization into the body instead of the lens, so I can find inexpensive used lens from people who are abandoning their 35mm cameras.   Weather sealing and rugged construction make it great for hiking, backpacking and my kayaking trips.   The Pentax might not be the most popular brand, but the cameras are the best bang for the buck.
