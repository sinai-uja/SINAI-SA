This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased.  I cannot overstate how easy it is to use this camera and all of the features it offers.Its does not run through batteries, it takes crisp pictures and easily fits in your pocket if you need to carry it on you.I have found that the menu's on the camera make it easy for you to see what you are doing and is not confusing, each mode that you chose gives you a brief description of how you would use each picture mode and makes this camera simple to use.The only interesting thing I have learned from using this camera is with night pictures and by the way it does an excellent job. You have to hold the camera very very still otherwise the night images turn out blurry. I believe the shutter stays open a bit longer during night pictures which would make sense. If you are unsure of what camera to own stop here and buy this one now belive me you will have no regrets.
