A replacement for my Canon A40 w 3x zoom and 2.1 mpx.  A world of difference, ESPECIALLY with that swiveling large size LCD.  What a help!!!!  Even in sun can adjust so rarely need to use viewfinder.The large mpx serves as an additional zoom factor, since when you set camera at max size/rez with very large mpx image, AND use zoom, you can get good image of smaller subject from a decent distance, nearly like using a telescope!!!Batt life very good, with the 4 AA as was with my earlier model.  Actually so may varients for pic taking I tend to get lost at times, but since I read the How To in manual only when I HAVE to, its my fault.Highly recommended.   Now all I need is decent aftermarket flash for additional interior work.
