        Inexpensive Camera Delivers, June 28, 2008
        ByNicholas Austad (Buena Park, CA)  - See all my reviews
This is a perfect pocket point-and-shoot. I bought it with a couple things in mind: 1)high quality photos 2)low price point. I wanted an inexpensive camera, but not a cheap camera - something that I can carry with me every day for a year and not feel like too much of a loss if it breaks. This camera filled all my wishes. It exceeded my expectations by taking crisp, clear video.Canon makes a quality product, and over-delivers on features. I've been having so much fun exploring my camera and discovering all the neat extras thrown in.The stitch assistant is capable of creating beautiful panoramas. Digital Macro is great for getting WAY up close and gets detailed shots. The time-lapse movie mode is loads of fun.I'll eventually pony up and buy a nice DSLR, but for now, this definitely meets the need of a budding photographer or anyone who wants to capture family events and whatnot.
