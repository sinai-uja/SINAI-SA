If you are looking for a simple, low-price, reliable digical camera, I would recommend this camera for you. Two AA batteries, SD card, very fast power-on, face-detected focus, and very useful macro focus mode. If there is a weakness in this camera, I will say, the zoom range can be wider and deeper. Although the size of the camera is bigger than other fancy compact cameras, it is not too bad for a big hand to hold the camera well.
