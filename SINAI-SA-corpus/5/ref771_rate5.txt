        Camera with a punch, January 18, 2009

I bought this bundle for my wife. The camera she had was under performing. I have around 6 digital cameras (Canon, Kodak, Panasonic). Honestly, the Canon digital cameras are the best cameras out there. Beside its ease, what sets the Canon SD1100IS apart from the others is its meter. While other camera produce dark, incorrectly metered photographs, this camera takes photos that are vivid, full of life.What makes this bundle double awesome is the Selphy printer. One can make beautiful 4x6 prints without having to go to a photo lab.
