        K200D - As good as it gets!!, July 9, 2008
        ByC. Beaudette "GoPentax" (Central Texas)  - See all my reviews
I recently upgraded from the Pentax *ist DS (DSLR) to the Pentax K200D and am VERY happy that I did.  I was never unhappy with the DS - it's still a more capable camera than I am a photographer - but I felt I *needed* to upgrade.  The main reason for the upgrade was Pentax's in-body shake-reduction.  I'm simply not as physically stable as I was and the shake reduction is everything I hoped it would be!!  Extremely helpful to us unstable folks!  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the shutter is a lot quieter - makes a difference photographing wildlife.  The dust reduction feature is nice as is the additional megapixals.  All is all, a VERY good upgrade for me.  Well built, dust and water sealed, and backed by Pentax!  Nice.
