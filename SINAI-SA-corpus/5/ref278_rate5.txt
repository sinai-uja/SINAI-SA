This PowerShot A590IS is simple and easy to use. I don't know much about photography and don't want to have to take courses to take a picture. I work in the Oil Field and come across some neat stuff. So it's fun for me to carry my camera in my truck and get shots of this stuff. This camera is easy to use to document and cover your tail with too. I recommend this one for anybody who wants a point and click easy to use camera.
