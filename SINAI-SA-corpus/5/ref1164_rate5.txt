        The Best $[...] I Ever Spent!, November 15, 2006
        ByAmy mom of 6 (WV)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera in April of 2005, and have used it for MANY pictures since (plus some video). I did a lot of research before buying, but really when it came down to it, I bought a brand I knew and it was cheap. Well I ended up with a great camera. I have 6 kids and scrapbook, so photo quality is very important to me and this camera has it. I use rechargeable batteries and they last a LONG time before needing recharged. Take it from a Mom that memories mean a lot to...this is a terrific camera! All of the lengthy good reviews on here are telling the truth. I heard a lot of bad things from "camera professionals" about Kodak, but I haven't seen any of what they said.
