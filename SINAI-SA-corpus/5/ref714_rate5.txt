        SD1100 vs. SD8500: Best sidekick for the average shooter?, May 1, 2008
        BySamuel Chell (Kenosha,, WI United States)  - See all my reviews
I started with the SD1000 in mind but soon discovered the newly introduced SD1100 before noticing that the identically-priced SD8500 was out-selling it on Amazon by a decisive margin.  Even though almost a year older than the 1100, the 8500 offers a few attractive features: 1. a 4X optical zoom lens, with an impressive range of 35mm-140mm (the 1100's is 38mm-114mm); 2. marginally faster shutter operation and less lag time between shots; 3. the ISO settings are reassuringly located in a familiar place (under func menu rather than controller) for users who prefer to make the setting manually. The experts' reviews admittedly favor the 8500, though I'm convinced present consumers are overlooking two things: first, the raves were written early last year and cannot be compared to reviews for a newly-made camera with merely "incremental" improvements (as the model number suggests, the SD1100 is the successor to the SD1000, which was the direct and immediate successor to the extremely popular SD600); 2nd, the marginally slower shutter time of the 1100 (lag between depressing the trigger and getting a response) is the trade-off for the addition of a new feature, Motion Detection technology, which acts in harmony with automatic image stabilization to recalibrate camera settings when extra motion in front of the lens is sensed.  Finally, the apparent unpopularity of this camera is misleading since it comes in five colors and Amazon is treating each separately in its sales rankings (go with pink and save a couple of bucks).I went with the 1100 (in silver) for several reasons: 1. It's closer in size, weight and appearance to the ultra-compact, classic SD1000 than the rounder and slightly heavier 8500 (for the record, the 1100 reintroduces the "softer" edges of the 1000's predecessor, the SD600); 2. the new Motion Detection system compensates for any additional lag time, providing sharp shots of kids and pets; 3. it offers an improved screen-- PureColor II (a noticeable improvement over PureColor under both extremely dim and bright conditions); 4. the focal length is ideal for the "people shooting";  5. at 4.41oz it's an ounce lighter than the other new Canon releases, the SD790 and SD890 (each 5.47oz). In short, this is the ideal lazy person's companion, one that makes a nice complement to the good life.
