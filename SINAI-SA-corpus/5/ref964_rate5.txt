Bought this for my 15 year old daughter to replace a DSC40 Sony. Start up time on the SD1100 Canon is amazingly quick. You turn it on and can almost start taking pics immediately. Its compact size lends itself to easy storage in anything a teenage girl carries. LCD screen is very clear even in bright sunlight. The automatic display orientation as the camera is turned is a welcome addition. At 8 MP, plenty of opportunity to cleanly enlarge selected portions of any image, which we did for a science project. All in all, great camera!
