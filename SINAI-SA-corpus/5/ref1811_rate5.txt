        Great digital SLR, December 18, 2007

Very rugged, fully featured; finally a digital SLR that feels professional in your hands. Solidly constructed, sensible controls, good ergonomics. Adjust the sharpening, saturation, and contrast settings manually right in the camera for outstanding JPEG quality. Best of all, I can use my old Pentax autofocus lenses on this new digital. I feel I finally have a digital camera that will do what my film cameras did years ago. There is a learning curve to it, as with any other new camera, but I did not find this one so steep. Great camera, just take the time to set it up properly, you won't be disappointed, it yields great results. J.A.Crane
