I've bought two of these for my company and one for personal use.  I'm considering another for personal... it is an excellent camera with outstanding durability.  On top of it all, it takes beautiful, clear, crisp pictures withOUT a delay!  Only my very expensive DSLR is faster, but not by much!!A must have for everyone who enjoys photography, but wants to have something they can take anywhere, regardless of the weather, and fit it in their pocket or purse.
