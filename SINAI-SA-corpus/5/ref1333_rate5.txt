        New Kodak Camera, October 19, 2005
        ByGary S. Glass "Gary Glass" (Sadieville, KY United States)  - See all my reviews
Very pleased with the new camera.   The resolution is so much better than the old DC-120 that I had used in the past.  Very easyto operate, and so far it has been very reasonable on the battery life.   Function is flawless, and I would recommend this camerafor anyone, novice or experienced user.   My only regret is that I did not purchase the docking station with the camera, and I willeventually add that as an option later on.   Fantastic camera,very reasonable price, and produces impressive digital picturesGary Glass - Sadieville, KY
