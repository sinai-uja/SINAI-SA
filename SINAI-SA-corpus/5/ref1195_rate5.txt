        Wonderful camera!, August 12, 2007

I've started taking more trips, and my little Sony Cybershot 3.2MP wasn't doing it for me anymore.  I picked this camera up on a whim, because it was under $200 and 10MP--the most I'd seen in this price range.What a great camera!  First, it's light and small, so I can stick it in my pocket on hikes or vacations.  Second, the colors are vibrant and the pictures sharp.  And third (my favorite) it has a timer so I can actually be IN the pictures I'm taking!
