Purhcased this camera ~ 8/17/08 for spouse and very glad i did.She is going on vacation with her girl friends and we didn't have much time to make decision on which camera to buy nor time for learning curve on how to use.She wanted:Something small and compact that's easily to carryEasy to use point and shoot ( no messing around with menus )Good battery life so she didn't have to recharge or change oftenNo latency ( wait ) between taking multiple pictures back to backStylishTakes GREAT PICTURESThe Canon SD1100 IS 8MP delivers.I really enjoy this camera.  Super easy to use.  Battery life seems pretty good ( i'll get her separate battery though for backup ).  Stylish design.  Compact yet feels good in ones hand.  Buttons work for both her little / petite fingers and my extra large hands.  Pictures look great so far.Items really like:a. starts up fast after pressing power on buttonb. lens retracts automatically after minute of no usec. optical stabilization ( haven't noticed any blur in low light pics )d. no latency between back to back pics ( possibly due to fast memory )e. battery life appears to be very goodf. recharging battery takes only 1:30 hr:ming. good zoom both during pic taking and when viewing afterwardsh. very intuitive and easy to learn all featuresLooked at following in stores: Coolpix 600 & 550's, Canon, Casio, Olympus.Money wasn't an object.  I really wanted to get her the best compact camera that was easy to use, durable, etc...This camera met and/or superceded all our requirments and needs and it's very inexpensive ~ $185.00 US. Added Bonus, there are tons of excellent ratings on web for this camera, so one can't go wrong, unless your needs require something this camera simply isn't designed to do.I recommend purchasing larger memory than what came with camera:32MB is complete inadequate2GB  is adequate4GB  is completely acceptableHowever, I purchased the Patriot SDHC 16GB Class 6 memory yesterday because it was so inexpensive.  Used to cost couple hundred dollars.Paid 59.99 + tax. I've had no problems with Memory. I didn't have to format memory. Simply inserted it into camera straight from package. It's fast. I'm able to take 8M pictures back to back without any hesitation or delay. So far movies are working fine too.# of pictures with 16G: 4599 8M, 3264x2448, Superfine 6266 5M, 2592x1944, Superfine 9641 3M, 2048x1536, Superfine 9999 2M, 1600x1200, Superfine 6040 WS, 3264x1832, Superfine ( WS=Wide Screen ) It's not weather proof / water proof / shock proof like some of the more expensive memory. However, i don't plan on using it in extreme conditions anyway. Came with free LifeTime Warranty
