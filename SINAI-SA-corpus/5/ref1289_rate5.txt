So far i've been impressed with how fast the minute you pushthe "snap-shot" the flash automatically pops-up andit's ready to take your photo! I have compared with the other2 older models DX7590 & DX6490 ..this one is much lighter and faster in starting up ready to take action with your photos!It also looks sleek ....but the Optical zoom is more amazingthan the other older optical zoom models!I've been waiting for this one to come out with using AA Batteries! But better and longer lasting batteries are the Lithium CRV3 Batteries ...they will last you longer and it's more convenient and reassuring that you can load up yourZ740 right away if battery dies down! I do alot of travelngand i'm looking so foward to using my amazing Optial Zoom lenseto capture the moment! (even though i carry this Z740 with me wherever i go ...it goes!)I also developed the pictures i tookand they came out very clear & colorful!  Of Course! that's Kodak Science for you...
