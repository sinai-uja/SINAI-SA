This is our third powershot.  We each carry one and leave our old A70 3.2 megapixel at our cabin in case we don't have the other two handy.  We have found the powershot cameras to be the most flexible and versatile  cameras available for everyday use.  The reliability of these cameras top notch and the picture quality is consistently good to outstanding.
