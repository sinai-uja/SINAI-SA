This camera does some amazing things. I love it. Not as sleek as the other cameras but i don't care. I'll take it with me where I can. I love the color accent features and takes great videos. Sometimes the format isn't compatible and can't upload to youtube but w/ a couple tries I get it. I love this camera. It was dropped a few times. I am determined to replace it w/ the exact same one. I've had it for a year and a half.
