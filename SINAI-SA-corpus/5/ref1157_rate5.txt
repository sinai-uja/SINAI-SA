        ByCasual Photographer  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera from amazon.com two years ago and it's been nothing but reliable.  It's simple to use and packed with features - other favorable reviews are dead on - but my story is about its sturdiness.  Today, I accidentally dropped it from a balcony 12 feet high onto concrete paving, and thought it was gone for sure.  One of the prong hinges for the battery door broke, the door itself separated from the camera, and the casing came open on one side.  I was able to pop the casing closed with a screwdriver, and reattach the battery door (half a hinge seems to be sufficient).  The mechanisms and electronics still work *perfectly*.  Optical zoom, automatic lens cover, flash, everything.  It's incredible.
