        ByYousef T. Omar (Jordan)  - See all my reviews
As they say, good things come in small packages! This is a performant, yet easy-to-use point and shoot camera. Takes sharp clear images on the fly, and has a couple of cool features like face detection technology, motion detection technology, and much more. I recommend it for hobbiests; Canon Rocks in the field of digital imaging!
