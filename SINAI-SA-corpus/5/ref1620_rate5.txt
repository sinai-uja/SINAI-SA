I recently purchased this camera.  After looking at many -- I previously owned a HP 797 -- top of the line 4 years ago and loved it.  My new camera is great.  I purchased it because I can take it under water up to 30' and take pictures when I snorkel.  The only thing I miss is the view finder -- I have to take pictures using the screen on the back of the camera.  Just a retraining of where to look.  It is easy to use -- again just retraining myself to use different buttons.  I like to 10.1 mp for a point and shoot camera.  The price thru Amazon.com was good too.
