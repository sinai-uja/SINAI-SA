        Awesome value, May 12, 2007

This camera replaces my original A80 4 MP camera.  I loved my old A80 but hoped for a larger LCD.  The A630 brings this along with 8 MP to handle larger prints.  All this for a price lower than when I bought my original A80!The camera is a little bulky and still depends on 4 AA batteries for power.  That is one of the drawbacks/benefits.  Also, taking lots of pictures with the larger (but must-have articulated) LCD will deplete the battery faster, so be prepared for this.  On the upside, I discovered that I was accidentally using the digital zoom on some photos and was astonished at the quality of the images.  Shutter lag compared to my original A80 is also a lot better.For general purpose photography and ease-of-use, you can't go wrong with this camera.  It is not slim but it is very comfortable to hold and operate.  Highly recommended, especially in light of its price and value.
