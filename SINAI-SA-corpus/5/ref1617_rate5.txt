        ByJ. Chang (Santa Monica, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
Canon, Sony or Nikon do not offer a waterproof digital camera.  So it was a no brainer that if I were to finally hang up my trusty old Nikonos waterproof underwater camera and get a replacement it would have to be an Olympus.  I have used my Nikonos as an all purpose outdoor camera mostly for my fishing trips taking pictures of my quarry in the rivers or the salt water flats.  I rarely went diving and don't really need an underwater camera, like the Nikonos, that is waterproof up to 300 feet.  Waterproof cases are bulky and expensive and therefore it was not an option for me to consider.  I recently took my new Olympus 1030SW to my Bonefishing trip in the Bahamas and was pleasantly surprised at how advanced and user friendly the features are.  There are three features that are new to me that I find innovative.  Panorama - combining three shots into one in camera.  Guide - shoot with effects preview, allows you to compare previews of different effects such as variations of exposure, zoom, color temperature, thirdly super macro - allows you to shoot super close ups.There isn't really anything I dislike about the camera.  The compact size is great, the battery last more than a day of constant shooting (without flash),  writing to the memory card is abit slow and can get in the way if you need to take multiple shots quickly,   Using the faster M Plus card, which I should have bought,  may speed things up.  I highly recommend this camera to all anglers and others sportsmen near water,  you can hang it around your neck or put it in your pocket and not worry about it until you need to take a picture. Having a camera with you at all times, instead of putting it back into a waterproof bag,  ensures that you don't miss out on any photo opportunities
