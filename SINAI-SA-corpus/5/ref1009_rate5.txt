Easy to use and the pictures are fantastic.  Read your manual so that you know how to use the cool color features.  I sat down and read the parts that I was interested in and about 15-20 minutes later I was set.  Use the camera features.  You would be surprised how many people don't use the night features and get terrible pictures at night and then complain that the pictures are awful--users fault not the camera.  The price is so reasonable.  I'm going to try and upload some pictures here of my black and white pictures with only the red color that I took in New York--so cool!
