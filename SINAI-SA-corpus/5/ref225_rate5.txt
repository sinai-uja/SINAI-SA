        I love this camera!, July 25, 2008
        ByS. Osborne (Wyoming, USA)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this camera after doing quite a bit of research.  I really wanted something that would allow me to learn a bit and do more then just point and shoot.  well, I'm learning alot and having a great time with it!  Have taken some absolutely awesome shots!  Caught a bumbly bee in flight!  I'm sure there are some features that will never be used,  but look forward to trying out some others.  Was warned about the AA battery annoyance,  but purchased the rechargeable batteries and pack so have been just switching them.  Also purchased a card reader ($9.00) which saves your batteries from downloading.  Am very glad that i decided against the other Canon model that did not have a viewfinder, even though that one seemed like it would also be an awesome choice.  this camera comes with a computer disc that has great options for organizing and editing your photos.  Overall, I am thrilled with this camera and think it was well worth the price.
