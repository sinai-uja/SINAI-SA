this is a very good csmera to own!!! i have had mine since it came out a year or so ago and it has proven itself!! its easy to store in your pocket and take out with you... it takes great video.. and even better, it produces some of the best pictures!! it was so good i had to get my girlfriend one too and on top of that... it came in pink! her favorite color! this is a great buy for anyone looking for a camera for ones self or as a gift for someone else!!
