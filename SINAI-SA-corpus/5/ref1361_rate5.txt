This Camera is remarkable. I remember when I got my first digital camera a few years ago, and it was a 1mp camera and everyone was so excited when those made there way on to the market. Now only a few years later, consumers are able to buy, 5, 6, and even 8 megapixel digital cameras. That goes to show you how far digital photography has come these days. - One thing that makes this camera stand out from all the rest is it's 10x Optical Zoom Lens. This lens can get you up close and personal with anything your trying to capture, and the quality does not degrade, because it isn't the digital zoom. I would suggest getting a Higher Capacity SD card, 256mb is sufficient for most people (159 photos at 5mp Resolution) but if your taking a long vacation get a 512 or even a 1gb card for this camera and you won't regret it. Overall this is a good value, and if your in the market for a Printer as well, check out the printer dock, it makes a great companion for this Kodak z740.
