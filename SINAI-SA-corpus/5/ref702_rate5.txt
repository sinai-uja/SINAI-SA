I have been using a Powershot I2 IS for the last 3 years. Very good camera with a fantastic 12X Zoom.  However, I wanted a camera to carry in my pocket.  So many times I just didn't feel like dragging a large camera with me to various parties or events.  This camera fills the bill. I carry it everywhere.The pictures it produces are stunning. The 8MP 3X zoom produces a picture that you can crop to the point that you get almost the same picture as you would have with the 5MP 12X zoom lense (my opinion). The movie feature is wonderful too, even better than the I2 IS. The camera feels great in your hand with a solid, quality feeling.  If you have used Canon cameras before the menus are very intuitive. I would not have purchased this camera (or any camera for that matter) if it did not have the Image Stabilization feature.  This is especially a must as you get older. By the way there is an advantage to the Brown color: If you have to use the optical view finder outside, the camera itself produces minimum glare for you eye to see more clearly through the small opening. The color also makes the LCD playback pop.  And as a bonus, it really gives the camera a luxury look, you have to see it in person to appreciate the color.I recently took it to a monthly card party and everyone went wild over it. So much so that one person sat right down at the computer and ordered one!  If you want a sub-compact, pocketable camera that takes great pictures, I highly recommend the Canon SD1100IS.
