This is a great overall camera. I like the swivel screen a lot. This feature allows you to take pictures of yourself or of objects in different angles and still be able to see what you are photographing. The pictures are very clear. The auto mode seems to work better for the most part than choosing a specific setting option. The camera is very versitile and easy to use. A great camera for the affordable price.
