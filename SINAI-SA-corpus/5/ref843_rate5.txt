        A great little camera/camcorder, August 14, 2008
        ByArthur L. Hands (Silverton, OR United States)  - See all my reviews
After much research, I settled on this little camera for three reasons: (1) It produces surprisingly good videos, (2) It has an optical viewfinder which makes it easy to operate in very bright sunlight and allows one to hold the camera close to the body--and hence less camera-shake, (3) It is small enough to fit into one's shirt pocket. All of the above were my criteria for a camcorder to use unobstrusively in a country where tourists are the target of gangsters and crooks, and where a regular camcorder would be very tempting. A bonus: excellent photos for a point-and-shoot!
