        Pentax K200D - Excellent Camera and Fantastic Value, July 7, 2008
        ByMA (Oregon)  - See all my reviews
An excellent camera with a wide host of features.  My short list of favorite features:1) In-camera shake-reduction.2) Ability to shoot raw and JPEG at the same time (or switch as you like with a dedicated button).3) Custom capture modes, including black and white (and many others).4) Ability to use any Pentax lens, new and old, autofocus or manual.  (The new DA lenses are superb in sharpness, contrast, and flare-control.)5) Excellent image quality.I used to shoot Nikon digital (D50), but switched, and glad I did.
