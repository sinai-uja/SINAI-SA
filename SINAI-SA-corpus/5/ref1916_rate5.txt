It is simply the best of its class overall. I love PENTAXES. I was a Canon person in film. Did not like the feel & handling of Canon lower model cameras. Their images turn out soft as well. I like PENTAX colors more than Nikon's.Just a great camera to enjoy. I also have K10D & K20D. K200D is my camera to just hang around town
