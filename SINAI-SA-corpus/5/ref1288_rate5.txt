If you are looking for a reasonably prices 10x zoom camera that is easy to use and takes great pictures then this is your camera.  I looked around at several different types of camera's including Digital SLR but settled in on the Z740.  For my general use picture taking it has enough features and quality.  It is a little slow between pictures but that is not new to me as a digital camera owner.  If you need to take hundreds of pictures a minute this is not your camera.  The on screen descriptions when you change settings on the camera were a nice addition for me (I never knew what half the stuff on my last camera was for).
