        A great all-around camera you can grow with as a photographer, June 1, 2008

I recently stepped up from my Canon Powershot point and shoot cameras to a dSLR. I spent several months reviewing cameras and settled on the K200D. I purchased the camera from Amazon in March and have shot several thousand images with it.This camera delivers outstanding image quality with very good dynamic range. The jpegs straight out of the camera are great and you can extensively customize the several picture modes available to deliver the jpegs exactly the way you like them. When you graduate to shooting raw, you will find that the raw files have a lot of headroom for recovering highlights. The solid compact body has excellent build quality with extensive weather sealing. The dust-alert feature is quite helpful and the dust reduction works very well. I recommend one of the Giotto blowers as an accessory, but I have only had to use mine once so far, despite changing lenses frequently.The 18-55mm AL II kit lens stands above the most of the competition both optically and mechanically (for example has a stainless steel bayonet mount) and is flare-resistant and quite sharp when stopped down a couple of stops. The icing on the cake with this camera is how well set up it is for use with legacy manual focus lenses. The shake reduction is in the camera so all lenses you use can take advantage of it.I use Sanyo Eneloop hybrid AA batteries and get between about 500 and 700 images per charge.This camera has lots of pros, more than I have listed here, it's hard to think of any cons - the SD card was difficult to extract until someone showed me to use the fingernail groove at the top of the cards. That's about it. It's a great camera at (currently) a great price.
