        First Canon in a long time - worth the wait, August 31, 2008
        ByEllie "Eilean Siar" (North Shore of Boston, USA)  - See all my reviews
Not going to try to compete with the highly obsessive (but informative) fellow reviewers except to say I'm pleased with this feature rich, light, small, ergonomic, 8MP image stabilized camera with a (now hard to find) optical viewfinder.I've always wanted to do time lapse video. This, like most canons, apparently, will do 1fps for up to 2 hours (20 minutes will net 40 seconds of capture - use tripod or set on stable place and work on your crossword puzzles). The regular VGA quality video is great with good mono sound. And I've been pleased with the quality of the photos shot at the 'fine' quality setting. Handles shadows and tonal values well. This SD1100IS is a pocket rocket for features - the manual (all in English) is over 200 pages. You NEED to read it to get the most out of it, but of course you can just start on Auto and do OK. Size was a major consideration and this beauty sits in a belt case I had and takes very little space. I use with an 8GB SD card now, so the sky's the limit!I recommend you give this serious consideration if you have some of the same requirements I did.
