I lost my older SD1100is due to my carelessness and thus had to come and buy another.  I refuse to replace it with anything else out there.  The 1100is is the smallest digital camera with all of the features that Canon provides in this price range.  $159 bucks gets you an excellent device with 8mp and image stabilization.  Honestly, if you are printing small images 4x6 or 5x7 then 4-5mega pixels is all you will ever need.  Canon on this camera kept the 8mp but incorporated some awesome features.My family uses this camera on a regular basis and apart from the occasional red-eye, we have no issues.  Did you know that you can actually view the pictures on the camera and remove red-eye before you transfer them to your computer?  Awesome feature again.The zoom on the camera and the flash are plentiful and in my opinion do an excellent job for general day to day photography.  This is not a professionals digital camera...but I would not be surprised if some of them had one in their bag for occasional light duty work.I wont go into details about what is in the box, etc...as that can be found on the product page.One other thing I would like to recommend, is the EYE-FI SD Cards....we use a 2gb version that allows for wireless uploads to your computer and various image sharing websites....its a must buy.  Why I recommend it with this camera is that I have seen very little to no battery drain when the Eye-Fi card is uploading images to the computer via our wireless network or from hotspots in airports/McDonalds etc...  See my review: http://www.amazon.com/review/product/B001ACXHXE/ref=cm_cr_pr_recent?_encoding=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescendingEnjoy.
