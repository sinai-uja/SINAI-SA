        Bydavid yakich  - See all my reviews
Seems to be everything that a amateur photographer would want.  Not too big, light weight, and relatively easy to operate.  There's a lot of bells & whistles that may take a while to fully explore, but set to "auto" it's very easy to work.  I like the optical 10x zoom.  And it's a 5.0 pixtel.  The Kodak software however is a little quirky for me.  Sometimes it appears to lose pictures, but I've learnt to find them with a bit of effort.
