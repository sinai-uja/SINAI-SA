        Amazing features and value!!!!!!, January 12, 2009
        ByOracle of Delphi (Crown Point, IN USA)  - See all my reviews
Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom  I ended up getting 4 of these for Christmas gifts because after the first two came, I was so struck by the quality, quickness of focusing, features and ease of use that I got two more.  3 of the 4 were for older people that don't have a digital camera, so I liked that you could pretty much put the dial on Auto or Easy and leave it there.  You can do that because there's a separate switch for taking pictures and playing back.  My daughter loves that function (she's 5).  She had a kid's camera last Christmas but the pictures and function of that camera didn't encourage her to use it.  This one she loves and has started wanting to play with the other features like the timer and taking movies.
