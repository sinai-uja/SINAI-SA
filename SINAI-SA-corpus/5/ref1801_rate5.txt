The perfect camera for me! If is your first experience using a digital camera for a photo studio you will enjoy using it. I started to take pictures the same day I receive it, and I was very happy with the purchase of this camera. The resolution and colors of the pictures taken are incredible. The only thing I didn't like abut the camera, is that I needed to buy a wireless transciver to activate the external flashes since it didn't bring an entry for a cable to sync with it.
