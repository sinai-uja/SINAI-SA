        Perfect Casual Point & Shoot, September 30, 2008

We purchased this to replace a Lum*x on which the LCD screen stopped functioning (and which does not have a viewfinder).  After some research, we decided on this blue Canon mainly for its size, viewfinder (!), 8MP sensor, and picture quality ratings.  We have been very happy with the color accuracy (especially when compared to the pictures from our previous camera), and that it performs well at exactly what we need it to as casual users - point, shoot, and churn out great photos.
