Excellent for work or play.  I use it mostly for work, but it's a great all purpose model.  I had the older version of this camera and used it for about 3 years until the display screen gave out, but for the price it can't be beat.  Easy to use - easy to hold.  Might as well get the 8 GB memory card also, you'll need it
