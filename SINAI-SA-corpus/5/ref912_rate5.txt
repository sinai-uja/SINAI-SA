        Worth the money many times over, January 29, 2009
        ByN. Oliver (San Diego, CA)  - See all my reviews
I have now owned 2 of these cameras so far. They are great and thieves know it. For those of us that like to have a small camera to take great pictures at the beach, a party, or in the snow, this is a great one. It offers many different shooting modes with include night-time, fireworks, snow... and several others. I am in the process of getting my 3rd now, and I know it will be worth it. Expecially since they are marked down $50 since my last one.
