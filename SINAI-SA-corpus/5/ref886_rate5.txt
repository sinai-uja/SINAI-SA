        Perfect camera for the non-professional, February 23, 2009

The PowerShot SD1100IS is the second Canon ELPH that I have owned.  The first was a 4MP model from about five years ago.  I liked that camera so much, I decided to stick with Canon.  I spoke to a Canon representative at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January and he told me to go with the 8MP model rather than spending the extra money for 10MP (as long as you don't plan to enlarge to more than 11X14).  I am completely pleased with this camera.  The photos look great (3-4MB each).  I also purchased a 4GB SanDisk card, which I would strongly recommend (the camera comes with a 32MB card which will only hold about 10 photos in fine quality).  With the larger memory card, you can get up to 30-minutes of good quality video.  Also, the battery life is much improved compared to older models.  I recommend keeping the instruction manual handy until you learn all the functions (which are many).
