I also have a Canon Powershot A540 that is the best camera that I have ever owned...until now. I was looking for a higher mp and a stronger flash and the A630 fits the bill so nicely.  It's as simple a camera with superb results as you wish, but also has more technical capabilities for the advanced photographer.  I highly recommend this camera!
