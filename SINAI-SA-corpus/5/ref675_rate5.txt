This was a purchace for work. We needed a camera with easy to read and use settings, easy to take quick snaps shots, as well as good close up, detail shots in close quarters. The flip out display makes it  very easy to use in a lot of situations. I bought two, actually-one for my use and one for the department to use. I also bought the same camera for my husband's birthday. It also takes video with sound, for those funny moments at work...
