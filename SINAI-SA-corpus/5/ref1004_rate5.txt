        Consumer report's Best buy camera, January 6, 2009
        ByKevin Fritts (Knoxville, tn)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera for my wife at Christmas after reading that it was Consumer Report's best buy camera.  She is so happy now with it's picture quality.  She had a Sony before and some of her pictures would turn out blurry.  This camera has image stabilization which eliminates that.  You won't find a better camera for the money.  By the way, Amazon was $40 cheaper than Walmart.  Buy it here.
