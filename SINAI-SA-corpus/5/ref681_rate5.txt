        4AA Batteries make this a winner!, September 28, 2007
        ByS. Valentine "Voot Boot" (Long Island, NY)  - See all my reviews
This camera takes wonderful detailed pictures at most every setting.  The swivel LCD can be very useful although it's left showing like a normal camera most the time.  The flash pics are well-balanced and look natural on most all exposures.  The real plus with this camera is the fact that it takes four AA batteries.  This means it has some more amperage to recycle faster - the delay one usually waits to take the next flash picture or regular picture is negligible.  Friends who have tried it say it's the most digital responsive camera they have used.  When I use 4 2700 mAH NiMH Sanyo batteries, I have yet to have to replace the batteries after a full day of shooting.  It's pretty hefty too, a little bigger than the normal pocket camera.  I like the heft, the mass, and so much that this purchase here was for my wife so we have two of these cameras.  In short, if you are looking for a responsive fairly reasonably priced digital camera that takes great pics and has very little if any shutter lag between shots, then evaluate this.  I own Sonys, other Canons and a Nikon digital camera and this one has been the best one so far.  Features galore, a choice of movie settings, nice big 2.5" swiveling LCD display, SD media, USB2 connectivity for fast picture download to your PC.
