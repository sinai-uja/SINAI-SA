        Love my new K10D, December 3, 2006

Just got mine this week, replacing my Canon Digital Rebel.  I got the kit with 18-55mm lens, and also got a 360Z flash and 50-200 lens.  Very happy with it, though TONS to learn on how to use it well.  It's solid, works well in 21 degree (F) weather as well as inside, and gives gorgeous pics.  The Shake Reduction helped me get some good dusk pictures at our local train museum.  Only word of warning, is that it is NOT a point and shoot.  By just doing that, I managed to get some blurry pics and some nicely focussed pics of the back of someone elses head instead of my wife, due to not figuring out the Autofocus yet.  But I love the ISO sensitivity features (adjust aperture and speed, ISO changes to match) and the shake reduction really does work well.  The lenses and flash unit work great too.
