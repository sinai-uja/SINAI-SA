If you are waiting for the digital camera that produces photos the quality of film shots -- without a lot of hassle -- This is it!  Look no further the Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP is all you need.  Easy. Light. Designed well. And gives you the option of looking through the viewfinder if you can't break that habit.
