I bought this camera for my husband's birthday and now he carries it everywhere with him, raving how great it is cause its so small. Most importantly this camera takes wonderfull photos with great colors that are very clear and sharp. We bought a 4gig memory stick for it and there is room for plenty of photos with a crisp and clear resolution. One thing is for sure, no matter how much your hands shake you will still be able to take great shots with this camera with the image stabilizer turned on. Overall this is a great camera to have especially if you are traveling and do not want to carry a bulky camera, especially with kids in tow.
