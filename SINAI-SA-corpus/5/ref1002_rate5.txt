Very, Very Happy!  I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas, actually I purchased the 1100 first and was equally pleased but the 770 through Amazon came out for $10 more than the 1100 and it is all silver with 10mp.  I have enjoyed hers so much that I purchased a second for me so I could leave hers alone.  The camera is light, small, pictures and videos are absolutely perfect, high quality and easy to use.
