        Worst service by merchant, June 13, 2008
        ByS. Koo "Day One Amazoner" (New York, NY United States)  - See all my reviews
I ordered a green camera but the merchant Amazon assigned shipped me a silver one. Reason? They didn't have one. They asked me to return it for credit but by that time I needed a camera. Now I am stuck with a camera I did not want.Just bad people.
