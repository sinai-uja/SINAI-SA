        What a Joke?, January 31, 2003
        By A Customer
Although it is a great camera, I rate it with only ONE star because of the way it is sold! If it is a joke, it is certainly a very bad one! I do not wish to give ant information about myself to find out about the price! Instaed of wasting my tame to play this stupid game, I prefer to right here on what I think about this silly method! I was and am interested in purchasing this camera, but before making any decision, I have to know the price, which I still do NOT know! If you wish to play this stupid game, them there must be something fishy, and then, so long!
