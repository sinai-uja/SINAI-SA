        Serious Autofocus Problem, January 3, 2009
        ByDon65  - See all my reviews
The SD1100 IS is my fourth Digital Elph camera.  The previous three have been wonderful cameras.  The SD1100 IS is not a good camera.  It has serious autofocus problems.  The autofocus in flash mode is not reliable.  Approximately 20% of the photos taken with flash are out-of-focus.  I have pictures taken on a tripod, with flash in which not a single object within the photoframe is in focus. I suggest you avoid this camera.
