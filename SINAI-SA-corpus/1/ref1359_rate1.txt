        Windows XP problem, April 19, 2006
        ByA Customer "acustomer2" (Malibu, CA United States)  - See all my reviews
I have a different model Kodak camera, however they all use the same EasyShare software. Running Windows XP, I could not get the software to work properly. After several hours on the phone with Kodak tech support, they couldn't get it working either. They said they are aware of the problem on some computers running Windows XP. It is now several weeks later and they still don't have a fix. They don't really seem to care either.It might not be a bad idea to consider other brands, instead of Kodak. Since, if the software won't work properly, then what good is the camera?
