        great camera, until it dies, April 3, 2008
        ByS. J. Cunningham "tumblingon" (New Zealand)  - See all my reviews
I've had the Kodak Easyshare for about two years now, and loved it--great pictures, easy to hold, etc.  If I had reviewed this camera until any time in the last month, I would have given it a 5 star rating.Then one day it simply wouldn't turn on.  I changed the batteries twice, and it wouldn't turn on.  A quick Google search uncovered four forums with other Easyshare users describing the same problem.  And the problem apparently can't be fixed, or at least can't be fixed for less than the price of a new camera, according to the local Kodak shop.  I know that cameras don't last forever, but two years of taking maybe 100 photos per year?  This is ridiculous!
