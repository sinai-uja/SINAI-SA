        Proof that more megapixels does not mean more quality, January 3, 2008

The V1003 was purchased for my wife as a diaper bag camera, as my Canon S2 is too bulky to carry around for those cute impromptu baby shots.  Unfortunately, this camera did not live up to the quality you would expect from a 10 megapixel camera.  The pictures taken indoors with the camera were always very dark, even in well lit rooms.  When you got close enough to a subject to offset the darkness factor (i.e., 3 feet away), it would be decently lit, but the picture would appear very blue in hue due to the flash.  After doing a little research, I have found that the modern point and shoots with a high number of megapixels do not have large enough lenses to support the number of megapixels.  I picked up a Nikon CoolPix 11 camera with 6 megapixels to do a side by side comparison.  The difference between the Nikon and the Kodak were like night and day.  My recommendation would be to find yourself an older model point and shoot camera with a max of 6 megapixels.
