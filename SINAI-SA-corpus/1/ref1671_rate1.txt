        Camera Leaks DO NOT PURCHASE, January 14, 2009
        ByD. Jones "Brewer" (Charlotte NC)  - See all my reviews
Bought this camera for our 12 day adventure trip to Costa Rica. Camera stopped working after day 6. Was extra careful to check all seals before using in water. After one day of canyonering and rappeling down waterfalls, another day of zip lining in the rain, some light use in the pool and a brief moment in the ocean it died. LCD went dead and camera was full of water. Camera was never more that a foot or two under water. Looked like the water had been in there for a while too since it came out green colored and the battery contact points were corroded. Have not even had a chance to see how the 300 or more pictures I took came out. Hopefully I can retrieve the pics from the M card.  It looks like a sealed unit and is not corroded. Guy on our canyoneering trip noticed the camera and mentioned that he bought the same one for his trip as well and it died 6 days after he was using it in the ocean for surfing shots. Very disapointed.  I am now past the 14 day return policy date too. Looks like the fun is just beginning on this purchase. Will add more details after I try to resolve this issue.
