        Don't waste your money on this one., December 5, 2004

Please don't buy this camera. This camera has the WORST auto focus you can imagine. I have used Canon EOS for over a decade. Maybe that is why I believe this camera is sub-standard. For indoor pictures, it takes a few seconds after you press the shutter to take the picture. Try to get a good picture of a young child with a camera like that! Even my 3MP Kodak takes better photos indoors than this one.
