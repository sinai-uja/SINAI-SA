        Decent camera, but not built to last, November 1, 2005

My Coolpix 5700 now gets a "lens error" whenever it is switched on, and it won't operate at all, nor even switch off again until you remove the batteries.  A quick google search reveals that this is a chronic problem with this and other Nikon models (the lens gearing in Nikon cameras is evidently quite fragile), so I don't know if it is worth trying to have it repaired.  Additionally, the flash on this camera has never functioned (it never would pop up), although the camera always thinks that it needs the flash even in the brightest daylight, so it never takes any pictures at all (instead showing a cryptic "SB" error message when you press the shutter) unless the flash is first manually turned off.  As a workaround, I have always kept it in one of the "user preset" modes in which the flash was disabled.  I don't like to use the build-in flash anyway, so this was not a big deal for me, but the "lens error" is evidently fatal.  I now see many other user comments online about these same problems, and about Nikon's unresponsiveness on the issues.  Some of these cameras have died after just a few weeks, so I guess I beat the odds by getting two years of moderately heavy use out of mine.  As my CoolPix 990 also died after just two years, I don't think I will ever buy another Nikon.
