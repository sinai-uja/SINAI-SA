This camera has good quality pics/ 10 MB. It is kind of slow. I bought one about 25 days ago. THERE IS ONE BIG FLAW. The LCD screen is not protected. Many digital cameras do have a protective HARD COVER for the LCD screen. This camera is TOO DELICATE. I have bought more than 5 digital cameras for the last 5 years. This is the FIRST ONE that I broke the LCD screen.
