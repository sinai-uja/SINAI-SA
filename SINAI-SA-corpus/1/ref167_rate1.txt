Buyer beware!  The A590IS requires two alkaline batteries; however the batteries last approximately  one to two weeks or less than approx. 75 photos.  The low battery indicator appears way too often.The A590IS has 8MP packed into a small sensor chip which causes the photo details/sharpness to be less than say a 5MP on the same size chip (it's called "noise" in a photo).  Advice when buying a digital camera; more MP is not necessarily better.  Look at the ratio of MP to chip size/capacity.  The lower the ratio of MP to chip capacity = more noise, because the MP take too much space on the chip thus blurring the photo with more pixels.  If you buy the A590IS, Canon packs 8MP on a small chip thus creating noise.  I had a Canon A610 for two years; 5MP on a small chip but alot less noise than the A590.  My A610's sensor chip died after two years (black LCD screen).  Bottom line, digital camera technology is not reliable; the life expectancy is not long.  At least film cameras lasted more than two years . . .
