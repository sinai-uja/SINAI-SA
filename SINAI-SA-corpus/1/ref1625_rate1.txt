        so disappointing , July 27, 2008
        ByO. Carballo (South Florida)  - See all my reviews
I used my new Olympus 1030 SW on a trip to Grand Cayman, after the first use in water it kept reading a message that there was a compartment open, which I could not see. The next day I was able to use it and I took hundreds of pics. Some were awesome and others grainy, but then again it stopped working saying there was a compartment open. I returned it; got a new one. Took some really great pics out of water, then the first time in the water after taking a few pics it just turned off and turning it on did not do a thing. I am returning it luckily within 30 days. But I am extremely disappointed in this product.
