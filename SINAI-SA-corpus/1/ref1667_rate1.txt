        Camera is NOT waterproof, November 22, 2008
        ByM. Grue  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera specifically to take pictures snorkeling in Fiji.  I had used it in the rain and it was fine.  Minute I tried to take a picture underwater (less than 1m down, and it should be good to 10m) it broke.  Water leaked into the body, ruining the card and battery.  Thankfully it was a new card and I didn't lose any pictures.I am NOT the only one this happened to.  Another woman at the resort I was at had the exact same camera and it broke the exact same way.  I, now camera-less and complaining about it, met three other people who had similar problems.  Everyone who has one of the 700s or the 850 has no problems.  But the 1030 is faulty.Thankfully, the camera was under warranty and it was repaired and the battery and card were replaced.  I still won't trust it underwater however.  I'm going to buy it a case.
