        Not Happy with the V1003, March 26, 2008
        ByLaura Leenderts (Hills, MN)  - See all my reviews
I have had my Kodak V1003 for about 5 months and I am not happy with this product.  I bought this camera because I loved my Kodak DX7630 but it didn't withstand a rainstorm (oops!).  I thought I would update the features and size and ended up with the V1003.  The camera is TOO SLOW.  I have a small child who is usually half way across the room before the picture shoots.  I have a lot of trouble with blurry photos and/or varying brightness and Kodak customer support has been unable to help me.  They suggest using a tripod but does that really make sense for a point and shoot camera?!?  I can take 10 pictures of the same item and get a variety of quality - some blurry, some too dark, some too light, and once in a while a perfect picture.  The most attractive features of this camera are the physical size and MP.  But 10 MP does you no good if the photo is blurry.  When the camera is working well, it has awesome color and clarity - it just takes a lot of picture taking to get that one great photo.
