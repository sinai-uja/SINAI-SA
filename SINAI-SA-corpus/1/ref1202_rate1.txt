        ByMB  - See all my reviews
We bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas 2007. She used it once, then it sat on a table until she went to use it again, and the LCD screen was broken. It had been a little more than 30 days so I could not return it to Amazon. I sent it away to Kodak to be fixed/replaced and they want to charge me more than half what I paid for the camera to fix a brand new camera. The camera stinks and Kodaks customer service, or lack there of stinks too. I will NEVER buy a Kodak product again. They do not stand behind their product. I would not give this camera any stars but the system made me. We never even got to see one picture from this camera.
