        Fragile LCD... Watch out.., March 3, 2008

Nice one but ....After 3 month light use, this camera has a crack on the LCD. I don't remember to drop it or hit it with something, but always within my pocket if I carry it.  It is useless now. Still function but can't see the picture.  Search internet for the LCD replacement and found some complain about how fragile this LCD was. Always a little bit late to catch the quality...There is a poor guy broke his second V1003 LCD. Not me for sure. Maybe a design issue..I will pay attention on the quality next time. You need to buy a protection case and good luck...
