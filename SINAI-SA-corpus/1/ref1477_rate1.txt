Well the 32 power is great for distance shots, but the lack of a color viewfinder and the lack of cd-rom storage limits the user to constantly replacing the flash cards.In the field, having to view the 2 inch plus screen to get perfect shots is quite tricky.I use the SONY MVCCD1000 which has a color viewfinder and a cd-rom storage capacity as well as a camcorder battery allowing 130 minutes of power.1056 pics at 640x480 can be achieved. Match that with a flash card and you will be dragging it on a wagon.
