        Lens Errors Still a Problem, June 17, 2008
        ByK. Marshall "Katmarsh" (Reno, NV)  - See all my reviews
This is the second Power Shot camera I've owned I've had the lens get stuck on in less than 4 years, but of course after the warranty ran out. I kept it in a case and was very careful with it, but the lens got stuck anyway. The next camera I buy will probably NOT be a Canon, and I've only owned Canons up to this point.
