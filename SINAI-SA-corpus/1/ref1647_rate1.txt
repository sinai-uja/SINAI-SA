        Not great...., November 30, 2008
        ByRobert Cleland "Go Jackets" (Dallas, TX)  - See all my reviews
I got this camera a few months ago to have a rugged camera that I could use at the beach and stick in my pocket.  I had a Canon Powershot SD600 before that had been ruined by beach spray.  Previous to that I had an Olympus Camedia D-560 Zoom in college which had been abused thoroughly and survived 5 years and mutliple countries.  I was disappointed with the Canon as it was so delicate so I decided to switch back to Olympus.To summarize...  This camera is well below average.  I have tried using it in a variety of settings and all have been subpar.  I waited to write a review after a few months, thinking I might be able to work out the kinks - but after a wonderful Thanksgiving - I felt I must mention this camera's inadequacies: 1. The camera takes rather blurry pictures when it should not - it's pot luck - some turn out alright, many do not.  There is a setting that is supposed to eliminate this problem, but it does not.2. I like simple cameras that don't require me to adjust the setting for any moment.  This camera doesn't allow that so when a moment strikes -pictures often come out either overexposed, blurry, or grainy.  Ridiculous for a camera of this price.2. The movies are absolutely terrible - seriously, I could probably draw a flipbook better than the movies this thing takes.  I was amazed how absolutely horrible the movies are after my previous two cameras - one 3.2MP and the other 6.0MP.  I realize this is not a camcorder, but it's nice being able to take brief movies when the moment arises - as my old Canon was able to.Overall - I am very dissapointed with this camera.  I have not used the underwater capabilities but have let my 3 year old niece use it to see how rugged it is.  Actually that's the best thing so far - I have no worries that she'll break it and don't really care if she does.Back to Canon now.....
