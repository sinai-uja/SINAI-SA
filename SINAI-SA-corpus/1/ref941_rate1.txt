        I gave this camera a shot and it failed me, October 11, 2008

I bought this camera to be used for an convention and during the convention it has gotten the fatal lens error problem. I have only had this camera for about 5 weeks and hopefully amazon will replace it or Canon will cover it in warranty. I really thought this fatal lens problem wasn't a problem but it is. I hope I get a new one and sadly enough I cannot take pictures for this convention I am at. I suggest stay away from this product. I will change my review if things are fixed.edit: Called up Canon and they were very helpful. They took a look at it and repaired it free of charge so it ended up only costing me the shipping cost which was about 12bucks with insurance/confirmation. Would rate 3 stars now due to good support and decent camera but known faulty issue should be considered in buying this camera.
