        Poor quality, not waterproof, February 4, 2009
        ByR. Ward  - See all my reviews
Do not buy this camera if you are planning to use it underwater.  I used it for two days while snorkeling and the camera shut down and I was not able to use it for the rest of our vacation.  The frame around the shutter fell off and all the black paint on the front of the camera came off.  I sent it to Olympus and they sent it back painted with the metal frame glued back on, but they never addressed the waterproof issue.The camera is a great idea, but the quality is terrible.
