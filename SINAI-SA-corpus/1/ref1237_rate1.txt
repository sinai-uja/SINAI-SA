        Broken Lens, September 17, 2008
        ByKatelyn Dearing  - See all my reviews
I received this camera as a gift and had to send it in three times to be fixed. (Yes, I am EXTREMELY careful with my cameras) First, the lens would not go back inside. Second, because it would not charge. Third, for the lens again. I used it once after it got sent back and it broke again. A waste of time.
