I bought this camera because it was recommended by Consumer Reports.  My last digital camera was a problem plagued Fuji with chronic reliability issues--so I have been a skeptical digital camera user.  This Canon is a feature rich camera.  Nice zoom, takes quick shots, good battery durability, easy to use and friendly user software.  I am confident in its long term reliability and consider it a good value.
