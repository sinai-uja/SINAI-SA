        What a disappointment, June 18, 2008

I read the reviews about poor, grainy picture quality-they all sounded like they came from more experienced photographers so I figured an amateur like myself would never notice.  WRONG!  We bought this camera because our old Sony wasn't taking pictures like it used to after being abused by our two young boys for 5 years-even after all that, our old Sony takes better pics at the lowest resolution (under 1 megapixel)in bad lighting than the Olympus at the highest megapixel (10.1) in good lighting.  We tried everything and couldnt get a picture that wasn't grainy, at best.  Also, DON'T EVEN TRY to take pics at a sporting event-the shutter speed and reset is so slow that I took a picture of my 5 year old son getting handed the football at the 20 yard line and it didn't reset until after he was done celebrating in the end zone.  At his Kindergarden graduation he had to walk 100 feet to the podium...I could only take one shot it was SO SLOW.  Definitely a DO NOT BUY...a terrible shame considering how cool the Shockproof, Waterproof features are.
