        A Kid's Review
  lets u film movies in HD mode one problem is the movie uses 700GB thats bigger then a dvd for less then 20 minutes worth lenth . I wanted to save theese to cd - r rom  but the movie I made with the camera where too big just the same size as a hollywood dvd . the other problem was Downloading the movie to my pc after dueing so the movie kept freezing up on my pc when playing. Can any body tell me why it skips on my pc. I was filming on boat in fast motion but it downloaded with slipping problems. when playing it on the camera it dident have that problem. its possible it downloaded with problems.. all it takes it one crew up and u wont be happy with this camera. Any body else having this problem ?? reply to my question & I will read it latter, thanks
