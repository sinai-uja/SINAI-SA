this camera may look pretty but i dont like it one bit. I got this camera last summer before i went on a trip to ohio. At first i thought it was great but now ive totally changed my mind. This camera has bad image quality and is not reliable. It also has an extremely bad zoom and its horribly slow. Its already breaking too. Ive had this camera less than a year and im ready to get a new one. So please- if you are looking to purchase a good quality camera- dont but this one.
