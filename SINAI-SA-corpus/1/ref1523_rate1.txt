        Rendered useless by chronic failures, September 29, 2005
        ByF. Cochran (Springfield, VA USA)  - See all my reviews
I've had a number of cameras in the CoolPix line, and been mostly delighted with them. Unfortunately, my experience with the 5700 has been a debacle. As for many who purchased this camera, the flash on mine stopped functioning a few months after I bought it for more than $1,000 when this model was relatively new. This rendered the camera useless, disabling all but one shooting mode. And since the feedback was just a cryptic blinking red light and a code "SB" (defined nowhere in the manual or online), it took forever to determine I hadn't simply activated the wrong setting--this was a defect that required repair. I sent it in under warranty in the nick of time and got it back about a month later. It worked for maybe two more months and failed again. Same story. Now it's out of warranty with the same problem, and it looks as if I'd get no more on e-Bay than it would cost me to repair this lemon. (Not that I could sell it, even repaired, with a clear conscience.) TERRIBLY frustrating and costly experience with the camera I bought to record my young son's childhood--now he's in kindergarten, I've had to rely on pictures from others, and those years are never coming back. Avoid the 5700. Please Nikon, don't do this to us again!
