Do not buy this camera. After using it for 3 months I got "lens Error". It can't even focus on low light condition. When you pressed the shutter , it will take at least 3 to 4 sec to take the shot. I called Nikon for service , and they replaced it with a new one. Adviced is do not buy this  Nikon 5700 . Lemon ... Lemon ... Lemon ...How about Olympus...?
