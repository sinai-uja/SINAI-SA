        ByHarold Behnke (michigan USA)  - See all my reviews
I have never been a big fan of company's that have moved there coustomer servise overseas . I paid high dollar for this item with the dock and printer .after a short period of time I started having problems with the camera , of course it was out of warrenty . I will never purchase Kodak again . Poor picture quality .
