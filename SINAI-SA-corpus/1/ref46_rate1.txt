        not a great camera, February 9, 2009
        ByBrianna Sapp (Central Washington, WA USA)  - See all my reviews
I read the other reviews and was very excited to buy this camera. What a disappointment. It was a pain to take a picture and all the pictures were poor quality. The shutter was very slow and the quality was bad. I ended up going back to my kodak easyshare that is only 4mp. Amazon was great about the return tho!
