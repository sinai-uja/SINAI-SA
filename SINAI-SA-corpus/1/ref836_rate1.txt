        Lens Error within 3 Weeks, July 13, 2008
        ByJames Lomas (San Diego, ca)  - See all my reviews
This was a great camera--until it stopped working completely within 3 weeks.  There was no 'incident' or warning... but half an hour after making some movies, I went to turn the camera on and I got the message "Lens Error, Restart Camera."  I've tried everything, and I can't even retrieve the photos onto my computer.  So even though I expect Canon to replace this camera, since I bought it for a trip and can't take any photos, I am really bummed that it stopped working.  I think they must have been using a cheaper manufacturing process, and we are all paying for it.  I've used Canon products for years, and I support the company...  but I strongly recommend getting a more reliable camera than this one.
