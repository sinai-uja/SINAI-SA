I previously owned a Powershot A70. I got beautiful photos and it was great for traveling. I own SLRs and know how to shoot photos, but I like a small camera for certain events.  I thought another Powershot was the only way to go.  I practiced with it for a couple of weeks and only got 3 photos that were in focus.  It doesn't seem to make a difference which mode I shot in, or the lighting conditions, every photo turned out poor.  I finally sent it back and I'm trying another camera.
