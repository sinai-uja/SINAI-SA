        LCD Screen Cracked!, May 5, 2008
        ByN. Thomas "yogasister" (sf bay area)  - See all my reviews
I had the same problem with the LCD screen. I had the camera just 3 months or so and it cracked. I had it in a pocket in my purse, so it was not without some protection.  After reading about all the hassles with Kodak customer service, I really don't want to go thru the trouble of mailing it off, etc.....I had an EasyShare a few years ago that worked just lovely, so that is why I bought this one.  But no more Kodak products for me.
