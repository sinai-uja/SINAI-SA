        Dreaded Lens Error - Beware!, December 31, 2008
        ByJ. Stahmann (Orem, UT)  - See all my reviews
I really liked this camera for the nearly two months that it worked, but unfortunately we were hit with the dreaded Lens Error which renders the camera useless.  Unfortunately Canon wants nearly as much to fix this as it would cost to buy a new one, so we have a nice silver paperweight now.
