        FIXED, and now works great! (was: Horrible with anything but ideal lighting), October 30, 2007

UPDATED: I sent the camera in after a phone call to tech support and there was a hardware problem (repaired, under warranty), and it works like a charm now.  I've added the CHDK set of tools (guide here:http://lifehacker.com/387380/turn-your-point+and+shoot-into-a-super+camera) and am getting awesome HDR photos and amazing tools.Sure, it has great features, but you might as well buy a fully manual camera, because you'll be messing with custom settings any time you want to take anything but a shot in ideal lighting.  Bright daylight? The photos turn out dark.  Night/low light?  Unless the subject is less than a foot away, the flash will fail to illuminate them and again - underexposure.  This camera ruined my photography of my trip to India.  Maybe I have a dud camera.
