Do not buy this camera!!!! it is the worse camera ever. We were at the lake and the camera stopped working and you can see some water had entered the camera. I sent the camera in to Olympus and they told me that I have to pay $120 to get fix after I paid $400 for it and they actually told me that I have to send the camera every year to get it refurbish. After complaining about the misleading advertisement, the lady actually told me you can go to the web and express your feelings!!!!  EVERY YEAR PAY $120 - IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY - AGAIN DO NOT BUY!!!!!
