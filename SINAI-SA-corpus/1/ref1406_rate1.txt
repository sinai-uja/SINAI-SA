This was my first digital camera. It took great pictures. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!! My mother and a friend each bought the same camera from my recommendation.But, after using it for only 14 months, it stopped working. It wasn't dropped, or bumped or damaged in any way. When I try to take pictures, the screen is totally black and takes black full frame pictures. I know this because the "view pictures" mode still works. I called Kodak and of course the warranty period ended after 12 months. They charge a flat fee of $125.00 for a repair and then only give a 30 day warranty.Really disappointed but have actually considered buying another simply because of the awesome pictures that I was able to take.My only advice...buy an extended warranty!!
