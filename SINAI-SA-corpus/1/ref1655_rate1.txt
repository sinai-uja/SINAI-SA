        Camera Leaks, August 1, 2008
        BySouthern Bell (New Orleans)  - See all my reviews
WARNING! I bought this camera to use on a trip to Anguilla & the camera leaked!!This is not a user error, I was very careful! It happened not once but twice & the second time the camera stopped working. Another couple on our snorkel trip had the same camera they had also bought for their trip & it too leaked. They were able to recover their photos after drying it out but the screen had water in it & the photos all had a blurry area in the same location on all the photos from water.It would be a great camera if it worked but I would NOT trust it with your vacation photos. Olympus clearly needs to work out some bugs before this is ready for purchase!
