        what a piece of JUNQUE, March 13, 2005
        Byradio100 "radio100" (Blaine MN)  - See all my reviews
I saved my nickels to buy a Nikon. What a mistake.. I did not believe the other reviews that detailed the poor focus performance of the Coolpix Nikon camara line what a mistake. Once I had purchased the camara I tried to contact Nikon for support what a mistake... Save your money buy ANYTHING but a Nikon. It is a terrific dissapointment both for the camara and the support... If you have questions about its performance ask your cat, you will get better results....I wonder, after 2 months how much I will get for it on eBay... No chance of Nikon support reading these reviews they have proved themselves unconcerned with customer focused quality.. Show them your concern by not buying Nikon....The SONY digital camara actually focuses on things..JUNK, JUNK, JUNK, JUNK, JUNK, JUNK... expensive JUNK...
