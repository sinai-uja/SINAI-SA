        Buyer Beware - Starts out nice but then dies at end, April 2, 2008

Bought it was pleased with it - had it awhile and now it kills fresh batteries after only a handful of pictures. A friend had one and said she took it to best buy and the guy told her the camera had "died" and new batteries are not the fix - there was no fix - same thing happened to mine.Please consider this possibility if you are buying this camera - would guess mine is a 2-3 yrs old and its dead. Suggest you buy a better name brand. I'm not buying Kodak next time.
