        Not really waterproof...., July 7, 2008

I am not happy with this product at all. It is supposed to be a waterproof camera and that is why you pay a little more when you buy it. It is supposed to be good at 33ft. under water but the first time I used it inside the swimingpool with the kids it was full of water and stopped working. I don't call this a waterproof camera so don't buy it if that is what you want to use it for.
