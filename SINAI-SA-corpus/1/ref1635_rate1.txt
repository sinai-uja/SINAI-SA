Well i brought my camera for taking pictures of me surfing. i read the booklet and made surf it would be okay in the conditions.  The first day i shoot  night shoot of some friends for 45 minutes. the following day i was shooting some friend in small surf when the camera failed and was broken. im very disappointed. 300$ for a camera that breaks in the first 2 days.
