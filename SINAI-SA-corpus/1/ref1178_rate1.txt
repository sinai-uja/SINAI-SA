Good out of the bad. After so much reading I got my CX7430. The second time I went to use it, it turned on and never work again. The lense extended and did nothing else after that. The good part of the story is that I took it back to the Kodak dealer here in Panama City, Panama and within two days a I got not just a replacement but the step up model DX7440 for no extra money. Not much to say about the CX7430, but a big round of applause for the dealership here in Panama
