        ByRosendo Lomas (Sanford, NC, USA)  - See all my reviews
Every picture I took, in all level of light, outside, inside, flash, snow scene, and in every camera mode possible (14 modes?) was perfect on the camera monitor but when loaded onto my computer was very dark.My lenses are: SMC Pentax-A, 1:1.4 50 mm and SMC Pentax Zoom, 1.4, 45mm to 125mm.Both are fine on my Pentax MX film camera, I've used them for years.Are my lenses not compatible with the K200D?Thank youRosendo Lomas, Sanford, NC,   [...]
