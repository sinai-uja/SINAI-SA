        Stopped Working After 6 Months Because of Production Flaw, January 16, 2009
        Bywonderama (L.A.)  - See all my reviews
This camera worked well after six months, but in the past week, after the camera opened, it stayed open and beeped, saying "Lens error, restart camera."  Google this term and the Canon 1100IS and you'll see many people with the same problem.  Owners who tell Canon about this problem are told to send the camera in for servicing and for their troubles are told that it's their fault instead of a production flaw.  A shame since I've bought numerous Canon cameras over the years and have found them to work flawlessly.  There's even a class-action suit over this to get them to acknowledge the problem with the 1100IS.  Google that and you'll find info on that too.  The only justice in this is that a company's reputation takes decades to build, but only a few problems to destroy.  They're frittering away their reputation, at least in the mind of this camera owner.
