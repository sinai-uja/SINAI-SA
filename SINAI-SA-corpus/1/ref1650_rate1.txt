        1030 SW leaked in less than 5 ft of fresh water!, September 7, 2008
        ByD. Morgan (Lake Tahoe, CA)  - See all my reviews
I bought an Olympus 1030 SW in May, and first used it 6/28/08, with 75 photos taken on it total. I last used it 8/28/08 when snorkeling in Lake Tahoe (fresh water, depth of 5 ft). On 9/5/08 when I tried to use it again, it started, beeped 4 times, then shut down. Charger says the battery is fully charged, and the "View" mode works (where the camera also indicates a fully-charged battery), but cannot otherwise take photos or videos. Was shocked to see that Olympus warrantee excludes damage caused by water, shock, or "abuse" to a supposedly waterproof, shockproof and crushproof camera. After the horror stories I see posted on the Internet regarding Olympus "No Service" and charging people to fix their defective/leaking cameras, I'm considering contesting the credit card charge I bought it with.Be warned! You may get lucky and get a "Good" Olympus 1030 SW, but their quality control appears to be letting some defective, non-waterproof units get into the retail stores. I would NOT trust this camera on a "Once-in-a-lifetime" trip !
