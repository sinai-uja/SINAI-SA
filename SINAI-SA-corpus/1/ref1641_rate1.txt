        Battery Charging, May 18, 2008
        ByCustomer  - See all my reviews
I will have to return this camera unless I am seriously not understanding something. I plugged my fully-charged camera into my laptop via USB and within 20 minutes the battery was completely dead.Then I noticed page 62 on the Instruction Manual where is says: During the conditions described below, power is consumed continuously and the battery becomes exhausted quickly: - The camera is connected to a computer or printer.So, connecting the 1030 via USB doesn't charge the battery as anyone with a cell phone or PDA would expect, it actually kills it! Quickly! Connecting the camera and getting distracted for a few minutes means you have a dead battery and no more shooting for 2-3 hours while recharge it! This has to be the dumbest "feature" I've ever seen on an electronic device. Am I just missing something?
