        Buyer beware, May 27, 2008

Bought this product about one week before a ten day vacation in the British Virgin Islands.  Tested the camera beforehand.  Have shot exclusively in Digital SLR for last four years.  Wanted a waterproof camera for snorkeling and the beach.  The 10 megapixels was a plus.  Minimal shutter-lag was also a plus.Here was the big downside . . . the LCD quit working after four days.  We took the camera in the water each day.  Never exceeded the fine print of only one hour in the water at a time.  Nor did we exceed the depth recommendations.  However, the lcd quit after taking it to a pool for about one hour on the 3rd day of the trip.  Tried to contact tech support at Olympus, which promptly sent an automated reply that I would hear within 48 hours.  Over one week later, I received a disappointing email that stated I could send the camera back and may be responsible for the expense.The camera shot great pictures . . . when it worked.  A brand new camera as well as a new product for Olympus should not be so unreliable.  Perhaps your purchase will not react the same way . . . but buyer beware.  Buy at your own risk!
