        Bysilvia elias "SE" (NJ Tnpke)  - See all my reviews
The pictures with this camera are of poor quality, and cannot be used for the internet.  If you have to take pictures of items to place on the internet, this is not the camera with which to do it.  We just purchased it, and took our first pictures today. It is worse than our old Nikon.
