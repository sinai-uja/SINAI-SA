I request a change of the first camera because the built in flash did not work,the same thing happened with the replacement, Nikon service suport center answered me saying that I have to send the camera for repairment!! I am returning back because that camera has a big problem with the built in flash!!! I recommend not to buy this camera, DIGITAL COOLPIX 5700 FROM NIKON.
