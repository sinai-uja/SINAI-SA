        Bad Flash and Customer Service, March 23, 2005
        ByG. Wesley Aven (Atlanta, Ga. USA)  - See all my reviews
I have been a Canon fan for years but a friend recommended the 5700. After only a few hundred pictures the flash stopped working and my friend said that he now has the same problem. I contacted Niknon and they said the problem was not covered under warrenty and I payed $170.00 for the repair. Hope it works for a while. I have now purchased a Canon 10D SLR and love the Canon. Do not buy the 5700!!Wes Avengwaven@mindspring.com
