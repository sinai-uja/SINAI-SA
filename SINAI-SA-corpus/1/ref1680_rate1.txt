        Consider another camera, August 9, 2008

While I've been happy with this camera for the past 45 days, now that I'm in Hawaii and on vacation, it stopped working almost immediately.  There are numerous positive reviews of this camera but it appears there are growing "issues" with an apparent design flaw - I count three reviews already from unhappy owners of this camera.  Unfortunately, we've already bulked up on xD cards and other accessories but are now considering spending a likely small fortune to have our unit repaired, after vacation, and buying another underwater camera, most likely a Sony or Canon with an underwater housing, to be shipped to us overnight.  Overall, a very expensive experiment with Olympus...and their Service Department was very unhelpful in this situation - send it to us and we'll fix it in 5-7 business days.  I would suggest you carefully look at your options BEFORE buying this particular camera.
