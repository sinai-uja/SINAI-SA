        A Waste of Time, Sometimes, November 4, 2007
        ByDigital Photographer "Used to Like Nikon,s" (Brooklyn, NY)  - See all my reviews
This is really a very nice camera, but with some glaring deficiencies, first the manual is next to useless, tells you just about nothing, it is disjointed, disorderly and at best vague.I think Kodak would have been much more honest to include a flyer inside which said, " you figure it out.The viewfinder in low light is just fine, but, go out in a sunny day with the sun behind you and you cant see a thing, I wish the camera manufacturers  would do something about this, 3 cheers for canon, they put an optical viewfinder on their point and shoots.Very sad part, this thing takes some first class photos, sad part,I will return mine.
