Kodak EasyShare V1003 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Midnight Black)  You cannot use the anti-blur mode with any of the other modes.  It seems very sensitive to movement.  If you use the anti-blur mode and want to take a close up (or any other 20+ modes, e.g. landscape, sport), you are out of luck for anti-blur. I find this really annoying. I'm certainly not going to carry around a tripod for everyday, ordinary pictures.
