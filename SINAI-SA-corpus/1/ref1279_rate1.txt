        Worst camera ever!, March 26, 2008

This camera takes horrible pictures.  They are grainy and blurry and in no way look like what a 10 MP picture should look like.  It also takes way too long to even focus & take a picture.  I owned a DX7630 which was a 6.0MP and it took far better quality pictures.  Do not waste the money on this camera.  It is junk!
