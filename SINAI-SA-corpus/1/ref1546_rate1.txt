        Coolpix 5700 - paperweight, October 20, 2004
        ByAlan Smithx  - See all my reviews
This camera stopped working after 2 months. (no image in viewfinder or display) Sent into Nikon Service, returned 3 weeks later with $0 invoice for Coolpix 4300 repair, stamped "Beyond Repair".  I had to contact technical support and have them track down why no repair was made.  They told me that there was "moisture damage" and therefore not covered under warrenty.  Believe me when I tell you, this camera never got wet or even used in rainy weather.  I now have a $650 paperweight and would never buy anything made by Nikon.  BEWARE!
