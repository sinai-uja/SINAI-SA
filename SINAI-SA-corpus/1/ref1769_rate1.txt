        Not really a warrantied product, April 8, 2008

Hello, The Camera is great, but if you buy it from Amazon and it breaks, Pentax doesn't accept invoice from Amazon as proof of a warrantieable product.  So basically amazon is trying to sell you an unwarrantied product.If you want it, go buy it somewhere else.
