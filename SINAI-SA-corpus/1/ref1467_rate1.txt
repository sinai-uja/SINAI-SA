        Most unreliable piece of equipment ever purchased, January 13, 2008
        BySteve (Texas)  - See all my reviews
I too fell into the "if it is Nikon" trap.  Afer reading many reviews on the camera, I purchased two as my first step into digital photography.  One for my wife and one for myself. We probalby have less than 1000 pictures on both combined.  My wife's has been sent in for repairs twice for the zoom lens not working.  I got mine out this morning to take a picture and the view finder and screen are both blank.  I'm not even going to wast 10 bucks to ship it back again for repair.  I still have several months left on the extended warrenty but it just not worth the effort. And...  everything about taking extremely long time to focus is true. This is the deciding reason for not having it fixed.  Even when it is working, it is a very aggrevating camera.  The number of good shots you miss while it tries to focus is unbelievable. Both of my Coolpix 5700 were pieces of junk.  It was a very expensive lesson about Nikon quality. With two cameras, additional lenses, battery packs, 1G memory disks, and extended warrenties, about 3K total.Since I've only owned two Nikons, I can truthfully say when the topic comes up, "Every Nikon I owned was a piece of junk.  I'll never buy another one.".
