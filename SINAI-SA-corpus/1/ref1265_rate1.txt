        Defective out of the box - $80 bill, March 30, 2008
        ByM. Cunningham  - See all my reviews
I purchased a Kodak V1003 camera prior to taking a short vacation.  The camera was defective out of the box (frozen lens cover).  Finally able to push the cover open (an unauthorized action), I managed to capture at least a few pictures and informed Kodak.  The official response - Kodak repairs but does not replace defective cameras (brand new units included).  Unauthorized damage/repairs void the warranty resulting in an $80 repair fee.  Buyer beware!
