        Surprisingly disappointed., February 11, 2009
        ByScott Gitlin "EssGee" (Howard Beach, NY)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this camera based on the mostly exceptional reviews on many sites. However, after using it one time and downloading the pictures to my computer the aperture priority (Av) and manual (M) modes would not function. I could not power on the camera in either mode. If I was in a different mode and turned the function dial to either Av or M, the camera would shut off. Since I had the camera for over 3 weeks, I got an RMA from Canon and sent camera back. Received a camera back with same problem and different serial number. What followed was a lot of grief arguing with Canon customer care. Fortunately, Adorama/Amazon stood by the product and gave me a full refund.
