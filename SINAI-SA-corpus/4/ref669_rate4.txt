        Great camera, October 10, 2007

I ordered this camera based on a rating I received in Consumer Reports.  I ordered the camera online and it only took a few days before I received it. The first time I used this camera, I was smitten by its performance.  I've never owned a camera as nice or as fancy as this.  I love it!  The memory card only allowed me to take 6 pics before it was full though. So I went online and brought an additional 1G of memory . . . and it is so worth it.  Now I can make a 5-minute movie along with taking a huge amount of pics and I never fear that I am going to run out of memory.  I am excited about learning what else this camera can do.
