For a digital camera novice who has used the same one for the last 5 years, this is a great design in terms of portability and lightweight. I wish the buttons were easier to interpret and that there were a simple mode to take basic pictures. I have found that the face detection aspect of it does slow down the picture taking. This is especially hard to overcome when trying to take pictures of small chilren who do not hold poses. The quality is excellent though.
