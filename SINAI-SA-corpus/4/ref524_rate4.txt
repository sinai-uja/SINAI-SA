        great camera......hope it lasts, October 4, 2007

The 630 is a great camera. Good pictures. My daughtr uses it as a video cam almost as much as for stills. Now I just hope it outlasts my first digital camera ,the Canon 610. I always treated the 610 with kid gloves, but the lcd died on this camera after only 15 months. This is something that has happened to quite afew 610 owners, but Canon will not admit to a flaw in this model. My review of the 610 can be seen in the 610 section.Why did I buy Canon again? We fell in love with the 610, the 630 has a larger lcd which also swivels. This particular feature I would find it hard to do with out.
