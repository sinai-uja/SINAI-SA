        nice little camera, November 2, 2008

I'm still not sure if I'm in love with this camera enough to justify the price.  Two little things I haven't liked...1) the battery life is too short.  Would strongly recommend the purchase of at least one spare battery, I will probably purchase two.  I took it on vacation  2) the response time in between pictures is a little slower than I would have liked.  Some positives:  The camera has a lot of scene selections & specialty modes that allowed me to get a few pictures that in the past I would not have gotten with a point & shoot -- like shooting into backlighting.  I didn't have to worry about it getting wet on rainy days or if I dropped or bumped it so that was nice.  The picture quality was good, I took most on 3mg & a few on 10mg.  I loved the size...slipped easily into my pocket.  I like the wide angle of the camera but I wish it had a little bigger zoom.  I'm still learning about the camera & how to optimize all the different options. The main reason for buying the camera was to have a durable, sturdy, all weather camera that I could use in a variety of conditions and activities so overall I'm pleased.
