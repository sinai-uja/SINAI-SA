This is an inexpensive but very good product. It is easy to use, takes great pictures, and is very flexible. My only complaint is that when taking videos, you have four choices for quality, one which is small and poor quality but compact, and three that are very good but take up a large amount of memory. I wish there was some medium format or mpeg4 format that would be easy to use. Still, I would highly recommend this camera.
