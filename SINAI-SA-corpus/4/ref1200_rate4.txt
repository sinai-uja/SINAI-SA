        A great little camera, February 17, 2008

I bought this as a last minute gift for my 18 year old niece.  She loves it.  She loves the color, the matching accessories, and most of all she loves the pictures that she's been sharing.I like my DSLR, but for a point and shoot, this one is pretty good.
