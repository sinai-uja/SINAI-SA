        Awesome Camera BUT DOES ANYONE..., July 20, 2005
        ByGina Jozaitis (Chicago, IL)  - See all my reviews
I just used a friend's Z740 and the first thing i noticed is the LCD screen.  Unlike any other digital camera I've looked at, this one looked like I was watching a fuzzy TV channel.  It has a lot of noise and movement, not clear at all.  When looking through the viewfinder, same thing... lights up and fuzzy noise moving around.I thought it was a defect and called Kodak.  After lots of time on hold, the man reported to me that this is normal on the Z740 and that it's their only camera that does this.  He said it's to compensate for low lighting.  It's very annoying to me to see such a blurry preview. [...]The pictures turned out great, but it was difficult to tell if they were in focus before I took them because of all the noise on the LCD screen.  i felt like i was using a videocamera.[...]Thanks!
