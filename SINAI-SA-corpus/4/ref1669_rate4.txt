        Great Little Rugged/Waterproof/Take-It-Anywhere Camera, June 14, 2008

I did a lot of research looking for a replacement for my aging Pentax 43WR. I wanted rugged, waterproof, compact & capable of unlimited 640x480x30fps video with sound as we go rafting, to the water park, etc and movie clips of good times are a must with us. The earlier Olympus SW series didn't meet all my requirements but the new 1030SW looked very promising, especially with the firmware update that allows for unlimited video when using the Olympus M+ xD memory card. Now that I've had it for awhile, here are my thoughts:Pros: Small, rugged, waterproof, easy to use for most simple point&shoot shots, good pics (not as good as my DSLR shots but then it goes where the DSLR can't) & good videos w/sound.Cons: Uses proprietary battery & memory card if you want unlimited video (annoying but minor), no optical viewfinder for those rare times the LCD display washes out, battery drains quickly when transferring pics to computer (I suggest the optional DC power supply & adapter, adapter should be part of the basic camera kit but isn't).Bottom line: If your emphasis is on rugged/waterproof & small enough to take anywhere then seriously consider this camera. Pics aren't DSLR quality but then it's not made to compete w/DSLR's and the handiness, ruggedness & video capabilities more than make up for pic quality for my needs. If it had an optical viewfinder I'd give it 5 stars in spite of the proprietary battery, adapter & memory card.
