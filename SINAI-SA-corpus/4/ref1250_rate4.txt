        A little homely looking, but a great camera!, May 30, 2008

I just ordered this camera, and so far its perfect for me.  I'm not an avid photographer, I just wanted a cheaper, decent camera that was small enough to keep in my purse. I really like how it comes with a recharable battery instead of needing double A's all the time like cameras I've owned in the past.    To me, the look of the camera is a little goofy and unfortunately, the booklet it came with is not helpful at all, but other than that, its great!
