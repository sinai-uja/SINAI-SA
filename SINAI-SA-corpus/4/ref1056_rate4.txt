        Great camera, November 3, 2008
        ByJersey person  - See all my reviews
I bought a Canon on recommendation by friends and family who have various Canon "mini" camears (e.g. Powershots, Elphs, etc).  I have to say that it's all around great camera that takes high-quality photos in most settings.  Even in the darkest settings, the shots come out clear and bright (with flash of course).  The only time that the shots don't come out superb is when trying to capture something in lower-light settings from a considerable distance - in this case, the shots come out dark though I think they can be tweaked when downloaded.   When you factor the size of the camera and the low price, this camera is a winner all around.
