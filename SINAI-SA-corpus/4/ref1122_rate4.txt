This is a great little camera, style and function.  I am a loyal Canon user, I find their products of the highest value.  My only negative with this camera is that when taking pictures indoors, they come out dark when set on Auto.  I am not a camera expert so I am sure there is a more effective way to take indoor photos, but for now, mine just don't come out great.  However, even if I knew that beforehand, I would have bought this camera anyway.  I am a satisfied customer.
