Over all I like this camera. I think I got what I payed for. The flip screen is GREAT, you can take a photo & be in it at the same time, all while knowing the pic will be good because you can see it while your taking it. The camera itself is a little heavy, and bulky, but over all a camera you can have fun with!!
