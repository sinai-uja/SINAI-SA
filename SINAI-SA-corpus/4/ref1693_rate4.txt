        Good camera, but easily scratched, July 6, 2008

I took this camera on a few kayak trips.  It performed great, is easy to use, and had excellent battery life.  One problem was that the camera insisted the battery cover was open, although it wasn't.  It took a hair dryer for a few seconds to the open battery compartment to straighten things out.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the lcd and the face of the camera were scratched for no apparent reason other than the normal exposure to gear and elements of a kayaking trip.  A camera that is supposed to be tough shouldn't scratch so easily.  I would suggest getting the silver as the scratches may be less noticeable if you plan to take it along on a similar trip.
