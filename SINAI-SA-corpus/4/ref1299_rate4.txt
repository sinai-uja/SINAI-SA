        Happy with camera, July 29, 2006
        ByMom of three in New Lenox (Illinois)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this camera and was going to return it because of it's size (actually purchased a smaller camera with a larger LCD and returned it for lack of zoom and the gadgets).  I love the zoom and the LCD is clear.  My one disappointment is that the optical viewfinder is not very clear at all - gives a distorted view as someone else mentioned.  I'm still on the original battery pack it came with after about 150 pictures.  The software is very easy to use.  I am a beginner with a digital and really enjoyed using all the different modes during a family trip to Disney.  I printed pictures by downloading them to my computer and uploading them to a local drug store.  I really obsessed over the purchase of this camera and after using it on our trip, I am very happy with my purchase.  The camera is great for beginners, easy to use. great color, etc.  The 4 stars is for the optical viewfinder.
