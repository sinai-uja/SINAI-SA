        Good Camera - Good snapshots, July 22, 2008
        ByBostonAaron (Boston, MA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera to take with me when my DLSR or my super zoom is just too heavy or too bulky to take along.  The old saying is that the best camera for the job, is the camera you have!!  I did not wish to spend a lot of money but wanted to still have image stablization, control over exposure and aperture,  and decent image quality, all while using SD memory cards since I have many.  This camera is a reasonable compromise.  The images are acceptably crisp and can be made even sharper in post processing, the manual controls work great, and the size certainly allows me to put it into my pocket.  If you are looking for a snapshot camera the Canon A590 can certainly produce the goods.  I haven't found the slow recycle time of the flash to be a problem and and the rechargeable NiMH batteries I'm using are still going strong after a couple of hundred pictures with about a third being taken with flash.  You can adjust the vividness of the color along with the sharpness and the contrast to taste.  The exposures seem accurate and exposure conpensation can be used to help with "blown" skies, a problem with many digital cameras, it seems.Having the memory card located with the batteries certainly saves in manufacturing cost (only a single door) but when I remove the card, sometimes the batteries also fall out, but this isn't really a serious issue - I just have to be careful.  I do wish that this camera had a wider angle lens (maybe 24 mm equivalent in 35 mm camera terms) since there are times I want effects that these wide angle lenses produce.  Of course I knew that the camera did not do this when I bought it and many casual users would probably not miss this feature unless they previously had a camera that a lens of this type.In summary, given this camera's price point, it's an excellent value.
