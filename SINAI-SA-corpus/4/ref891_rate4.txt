Ordered this camera to replace a model just above this one.  I needed it quick and the difference in price is what sold me.  It had the same features as my other camera except for a smaller viewing area.  I was able to order this camera and pay for expedited shipping and still saved over $50.00 on the cost of the other camera.  This camera is easy to use and has a lot of fun neat features.  Highly recommended!
