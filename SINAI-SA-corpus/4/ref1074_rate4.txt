        Very Excited About My New Camera, May 27, 2008

This is my 3rd Canon camera.  I have two small kids.  So saying that I take a lot of pictures is an understatement.  I love taking pictures and this is a great camera.  I searched and reviewed all of the canon cameras very diligently before deciding on this camera.  I wanted a Rebel XTI, but it is a little out of my budget right now.  I wanted a camera that would take good quality pictures (like for my Alaska Cruise coming up in June) as well as take great pics of my kids. Some of the other canon cameras had features different from this one and I had a hard time deciding.  But, this camera was a great choice!  This image stabilization is great.  It has some great functions for kids, like a continuous shot function.  Great for capturing my son hit the ball and run to 1st base.  It has this color filter where everything is black and white, except for my sons blue baseball jersey.  I have had a good time with this camera so far.  Great pictures, neat tools.  The technology just keep getting better. A friend of mine got the same camera about the same time I did.  Her second Canon camera.  She has also had great results.  Great camera!
