        One of the best digicams available..., March 7, 2004

Yes, this camera has flaws.  It is not perfect.  It has problems with low light.  The buttons on the side can be hard to use, and it can be difficult to find the right one when you do want to use them.But this is still one of the very best digicams on the market, for any amount of money.  Nikon has introduced a new 8700 model, but I am not yet convinced that it's actually better -- higher number of pixels doesn't help, if the quality of the pictures is worse (so far, the jury does not yet seem to have come back with a verdict on that issue).  Nikon also has their D1 and D2 series now (true professional SLRs, with the D2H being the first ever that is truly suitable for professional sports photographers), as well as the D70.But for prosumers, being able to see the picture on the LCD display as you are framing the shot, is very, very important.  It's also important to be able to see the display when you are holding the camera at odd angles.  The Canon 300D (a.k.a., Digital Rebel) is a good entry-level digital SLR, and is the first to allow you to see the picture on the LCD display as it is being framed.  But the display doesn't flip out and twist, unlike almost all the other truly successful prosumer digicams.If/when Nikon can come out with an SLR camera with the kind of resolution of the D70 (and the ability to change lenses, etc... like all SLRs), but with a flip-n-twist LCD display like the 5700/8700, they will permanently take the market back from Canon.  Until then, you have to ask yourself which features you want more than others.
