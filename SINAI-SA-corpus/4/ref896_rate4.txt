        A great entry level point and shoot - with reservations, February 17, 2009
        ByLarushka "Larushka"  - See all my reviews
We've used Canon point and shoots for several years and without a doubt they consistently take the best photos.  Bought this as an entry-level replacement camera for my husband (who unfortunately dropped his last one), and who is not very technically minded.  And he absolutely loves it and is taking much better photos now. This is a great point-and-shoot camera for a beginner, or someone who doesn't want to mess with settings - or as a back-up if you have a much bigger better camera and just want something that will fit in your pocket, but still give you a great quality photo.This model includes face recognition, which seems to be the latest trend now - but it works just great.  Said husband always used to manage to take out of focus pictures whenever there were two people in the shot - because the camera would focus between them - face recognition successfully resolves that problem.Image stabilization helps to avoid the blurs.  Also offers great quality movies that you can zoom in and out of while shooting.However - it is quite tricky to access the great choice of pre-defined settings: the usual suspects such as indoor, outdoor, sports, etc. and some great extras like fireworks, aquarium, underwater, kids, color swap (there's more).  They are a couple of menus deep, and not very intuitive to find. We never use these settings, and still manage to get good shots 99/100. But - they're there for the beginner who wants to be a little more adventurous.  Also, the zoom button is a little difficult to manoever.  It comes with a printed manual (rare these days) that really does give excellent instruction on how to use all the different modes.In summary - if you want an entry level point-and-shoot that is pretty much guaranteed to give you beautiful quality pictures, this is your camera.
