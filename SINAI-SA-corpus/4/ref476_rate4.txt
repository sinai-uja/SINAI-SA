        Comparing to Sony Cybershot, March 27, 2007
        ByJ. B. Hawse (Virginia)  - See all my reviews
From what I have learned so far from using the camera, I really like the Canon.  I previously owned a Sony Cybershop and loved it. I based my choice of a Canon this time on the great review in Consumer Report.  I have been very happy with the pictures, but thus far I still take better pictures with my Sony.  I am assuming this is because of my inexperience with the Canon at this point.  It has the characteristics I need, is less complicated than my Sony and I am looking forward to taking some great pictures with it.Canon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom
