        point and shoot for grandma, January 8, 2009
        ByEssie Shoemaker (Midwest, USA)  - See all my reviews
We have another model and bought this as a gift for my 80 year old mother who had expressed an interest in a digital camera. (And also purchased some rechargeable batteries and a recharger). It is not a pocket size, but it is pretty small.It seems to take fine pictures for her purposes. With a short hands-on experience, she is comfortable with it. Despite a little arthritis in her hands, she can open the battery/SD card compartment to change batteries or take the card out for reading on her computer. We chose it because it had a view finder as well as the screen. (I appreciate using the viewfinder when I don't have my reading glasses handy since then I can't focus well on any 'screen'. I imagined that the same would apply for my mother). It can be a little slow in taking pictures, but from our experience with another model, that will be alleviated when we get a fast (class 6) SDHC card for her. It came with a 512MB card that was nothing special. It would be sensible to upgrade that as soon as possible with something like a 4 or 8GB class 6 card and high speed card reader.The only thing I do not like (perhaps I just didn't read the manual carefully enough to figure it out) is I cannot change the stored image names to a more unique and identifiable naming scheme that uses the date in the name. The best I can do is specify that it never reuse a number over, but it starts at img_0001.jpeg and goes from there.
