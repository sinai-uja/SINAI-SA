I have been using the 5700 for a few days. Upgraded from Kodak DC290. Here are my comments:Pros: Superb quality; amazing optics. very compact. easy to use. superb wide angle to telephoto zoom range. for most people, no need for any wide angle & telephoto attachments. what else can u ask for in a camera. Deserves to be included in the Nikon family. u need to spend an hour to read the manual to get the best out of it.Cons: 2 issues u should take into consideration before u buy: (1) when lighting is low and u use the digital zoom, the image is most of the time out of focus. Plus, it takes 4-5 seconds after u press the trigger before it takes the picture. This is the ONLY problem with the 5700. I would have given it a 5 or even 6 stars if it could focus fast and accurately in low light situations. (2) I am still getting used to the LCD view finder. I have used the Nikon F2 and F2A for 20+ years and the DC290 for 2yrs. Both used "regular" viewfinder. If u dont find it convenient to use an LCD viewfinder, u may want to try another camera.
