----begin sillyness---->I got my camera delivered at work, so I sat at my desk working, thinking about getting home to crack open the box and start playing with my first new camera in 3 years.  The sweat pouring on my brow.  "Sir, do you mind if I go home early?"  I moused to my boss."Did you finish the such-n-such account?" "Yup!", with enthusiasm."Have fun....""Thanks!" As I grabbed my coat and dashed out the door before he changed his mind, I almost ran out without the camera!----end sillyness---->Upon opening the package, I read the manual a bit, then started up the camera and took some sample pictures.  All very easy, straightforward, and the little icons on the buttons mirror the purpose of the buttons (intuitive!).  Then I followed the directions to install the software for connecting the camera directly to the computer.  Unfortunately, after many hours of frustration, I could not get the software installed.  However the second tech support guy I talked to about the issue was very knowledgeable and explained that I needed to reinstall Windows because I was missing a required windows file.  Otherwise, the camera is way better than my old Sony Cybershot 3 megapixel, but not only because of the megapixel difference.  The options available are excellent (panoramic stitch, nice video quality, etc).  The reason I did not give 5 stars is because it has difficulty focusing sometimes which seems to get worse when zooming in.  Perhaps all digital zooms are like this, but this is easily remedied by releasing the button, turning the camera slightly, and refocusing.  After the picture is in focus, turn the camera back to the subject and it's perfect!  Overall, a much better experience than the old Sony and the memory cards are cheaper.
