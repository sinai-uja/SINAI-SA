This camera is a great beach camera.  It is waterproof to 33 Ft and can withstand bumping and banging.  It was fun to take it in the water and shoot pictures snorkeling, boating, swimming, etc.  The picture quality is very good, but we did have some issues with the video.  When zooming in while taking a video, the video quality became very blurry.  Also, the way the camera is designed your fingers get in the way of the speaker and you end up with a bumping noise on your videos.  The only other complaint is that while the camera itself is durable, the finish on the camera scratches easily.  After only a few days of use, it looked very 'beat up'.  While this doesn't affect how it works, it looks bad cosmetically.
