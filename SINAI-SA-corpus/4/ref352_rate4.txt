        Be prepared for the BEST budget camera! EVER, August 9, 2008

I got this camera on sale for $148 + free memory card, and it's possibly the best digital camera I've ever dealt with. It may be bulky, but this allows it to have the capability and options to customize and take so many great shots, more than ultra-compacts. I have used both lithium digital camera batteries and rechargable batteries, which both seem to have lasted me forever! Please try to avoid normal AA batteries. The quality comes out very vibrant, clear, and nice, + the image stability is awesome. This camera can make a little amateur photographer out of you! Works well for travel, occasions, events, of simple picture taking (I've used it for all those). The video quality is very decent, as well as the microphone picks up very well. Quality and price are the strong points here, and it's really hard to beat.
