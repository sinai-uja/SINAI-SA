        Nice camera, March 11, 2007

This is an amazing camera for the average amateur photographer. Nice picture and video quality. Compact enough to fit in your jeans pocket (if you wear them baggy), but not too small that it will be easily misplaced. I am not a big fan of the memory card placement (in the compartment where the battery goes), but the pictures look quite nice, and the zoom covers my basic needs.
