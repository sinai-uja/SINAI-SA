        Good Camera, great pictures, black screen?, November 11, 2008
        ByM. Lynch (VT)  - See all my reviews
This is a great camera for the price.  I have taken tons of pictures in the National Parks, Ski Mountains, Family gettogethers.  I would recomend this camera.  I have a personal preference not to use the Auto Mode.  I set it up for portrait or Landscape most of the time.  Great large pictures of blue skys and snow.  The large flipout screen is great for taking pictures when you put the camera on a tripod or want to take a night shot and need to set the camera down.After owning my camera for about 16 months, my camera LCD screen went black.  The pictures were black and the camera was useless.  I went directly to the Cannon Website and opened a repair.  I paid for shipping to them.  They actually paid for the repair and they will pay the shipping back to you.  In my case worst that would have happend was they tell me it's expensive to fix and they pay to ship it back and I buy a new one.  This is the second powershot I have owned, I had a A540 and had no problems with it.  I wanted more Mgps.
