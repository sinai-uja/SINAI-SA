[ASIN:B0011ZK6PC Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Blue)]]Small enough for my purse!  Easy to use.  Fun and accessible.  Manual was a cinch for the most part, even hooking up to the printer.  Beautiful pictures!! I wish the memory card was a bit bigger.  Also, a small case wouldn't have hurt.  Otherwise, almost perfect!
