        Great camera, January 10, 2009
        ByZico Gordon (Kingston, Jamaica)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera b/c it was so similar to my first ever digital camera a Canon which was excellent but as time went by I decided to upgrade and was conned into buying a panasonic lumix LS70. It took crappy pictures even my old Canon took better pictures, so not even a year and I decide to get a new camera and went back to old faithful Canon and I am not disappointed. The camera takes excellent pictures, easy to use if I just want to take some quick shots and good manual settings for when I want to experiment with taking some shots. I actually like the size, most people may not like it but I am notorious for dropping my tech items and it would be the death of compact cameras in my hand. Even with its size it will fit in a average sized jeans pocket or even a small purse in the case of a woman. The only setback why I gave it a four is that when the flash is on there is a delay for taking the next shot but I believe most can live with that. Advice - get some 2400nimh AA batteries it helps with the lag.Highly recommend
