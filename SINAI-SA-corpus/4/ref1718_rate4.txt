        Perfect gift for those a little less than careful..., January 7, 2009

I bought this for my mom and I also bought one for my boyfriend, they both have exclaimed it was their favorite Christmas gift.  It's durable, sleek, and lightweight.  It does not give away the fact that it is - for all accidental occurences - virtually indestructible. The options for taking different types of pictures are numerous, but if you are able to take good care of your camera, you don't really need to add the option that makes it able to endure 220lbs of force.  The zoom option is also not too significant, if you really like taking close-ups from far away, I suggest a different model.
