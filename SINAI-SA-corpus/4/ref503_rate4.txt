If you're anything like me, you're not exactly digital camera savvy. You may not understand what exactly ISO has to do with a shot, or the benefits of using Macro or different lens settings. Before buying this camera, I owned a Fuji Fine Pix camera. It was everything a beginner's camera was supposed to be. It was easy to use, but the ease came at the sacrifice of having great looking pictures. That isn't the case with the Canon A630.The Canon A630 is a professional like camera that is made for the use of both amateurs and mastery photographers. It comes with a host of features and is relatively easy to get used to using. I've owned this camera for nearly 2 years, and have yet to have a major problem with it. The only minor problem I have had is battery life, but I bought a rechargable battery for the camera, and that's improved my issue with batteries. I took this camera abroad to Europe with me to cover my trip, and the photos turned out great. Clear, vivid, and crisp. I definitely recommend this camera to any and everyone. If you're looking for a great camera, but are a bit intimidated by being overwhelmed with the technical aspects, then the Canon A630 is the camera for you. Easy to use and great results.
