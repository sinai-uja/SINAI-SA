        Great Camera, December 28, 2008
        ByJMU "Ben" (Arlington, VA USA)  - See all my reviews
For a point and shoot, this camera is great.  I highly reccommend this as far as point and shoots go and a Canon SLR Digital if you are looking for zoom and the highest quality digital pics.PROS:- Practically indestructable (I throw in my back pocket all the time, take it fishing, have used it under water and have had zero problems). I haven't tried freezing it, but I have dropped it a time or two).- No lens telescopes out, so I can get pictures when people aren't expecting it, so it makes for funny off-guard pics.- Very Clear Pictures- I like the sunset function. I'll try going back and posting a photo I took with it in this function.- Have had multiple compliments on the Stainless FinishCONS: - Short delay in pushing down on button and the camera taking the pic, but probably no worse than any other camera in this price range- Zooming capability is not there, but again, its a point-and-shoot so I was looking for more durability and small size to carry around with me. - I need to discover how to save battery life.  It runs out quickly.- Does not use standard memory cards.  You have to buy the Olympus ones.OVERALL: Great buy for the price, my friend has the model with fewer megapixels and convinced me to purchase this one for the waterproof aspect and I am glad I did.  We both like ours a lot.
