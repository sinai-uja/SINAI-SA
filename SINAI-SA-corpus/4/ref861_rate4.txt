        Nice and Simple, June 7, 2008
        ByJ. Brown (London, England)  - See all my reviews
This is a simple little camera and is quick in every way.  I have had a few canon cameras in the past and not too much has changed.  You get solid photos from this point and shoot.  Not as good as a digital SLR but then again the cost and size make those every day trips great.  If you are looking for a nice little camera, that takes very good photos, quick to start up and easy to use, this is the one for you.Enjoy.
