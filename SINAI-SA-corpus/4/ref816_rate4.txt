I received this camera a few weeks ago and have been satisfied with it.What I wanted to do with the camera was simple.Take varies pictures and keep them on the computer.I also take a few short videos.For that the camera is perfect.It fell from the bed once,which is about a two feet drop and I was glad to see it didn't break apart or make the camera malfunction in any way.The only thing I'm disappointed by is the fact that when the subject stands four feet or more away from the camera it's very blurry.And forget about taking a full body shot.All you'll get is basically a blur.It does work with small children.My niece is three and I can get a pretty good full body shot of her.Over all I'll give it four stars.
