        Great Camera, January 17, 2008
        A Kid's Review
I got this camera for Christmas, and I love it. It takes really amazing photos, and has great features, like PerfectTouch technology. I just wish you could put a frame on the pictures, like some other cameras do. But besides that, I only have good things to say about the Kodak V1003 Digital Camera.
