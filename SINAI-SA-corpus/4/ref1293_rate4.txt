        Lovely replacement camera, November 25, 2005
        BySyouki  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera to replace my Kodak DX4330 that was stolen earlier this year.  I love how easy this camera is to use and the quality as well as zoom.  The outside colors are wonderful.  My only problem with the camera is the quality of the inside colors.  I've tried various settings and they continue to come out rather a little dark unlike my 4330.  I still love this camera though and wouldn't change it for any other camera.  Thank you Kodak for another lovely camera.  The 10x zoom is one of the things that got me to purchase this.  And I agree that I'd like to be able to zoom while filming, but the first time I used the video feature was at a United Way truck pull infront of my place of employment as I had to film and take photos.  I was amazed at how well the video turned out.
