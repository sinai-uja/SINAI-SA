While I am quite happy with the ease of use, great price, high quality photos and overall layout of the camera, I was surprised to find out that you can not view the scene through the LCD display when taking a photo. You have to use the standard view finder to view and then after taking the photo you can then see your recent or all photos. It is a great camera and I'll just have to put up with it.
