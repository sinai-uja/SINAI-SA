        Olympus 1030 SW, June 18, 2008

Bought as replacement for old Konica-Minolta Dimage Xg (broken display).So far happy of this optimised purchase when looking for sleeky design and increased protection level.Optical viewfinder + manual focusing function would make this camera perfect = having everything I need.
