I bought this camera for a pocket, take it anywhere. It takes greatpictures, just the right size for a small camera for my hands. Despitethis, i have dropped it twice, once on pavement, once on concrete. Tomy amazement, it survived unscathed both times. Can't guarantee theseresults, but I am pleased. Only drawback I see is it is mediocre on battery life. Highly recommended.
