        Expensive Item, but worth every penny, July 29, 2008

I'm not a camera expert by any means, so this is not a very technical review. I bought this camera to take to the Caymans for vacation. It worked great for underwater and regular shots. I bought a microSD instead of the Olympus XD and it worked fine. The only advice I can tell you is make sure you swap modes once you get back out of the water or else your pictures will look weird. Also, watch your thumb when you take pics.
