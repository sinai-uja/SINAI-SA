I will try and keep this one fairly short.  I've had this camera for about six months now and absolutely love it.  I have a pro SLR so I do not use this camera with the intent of taking prize winning photos, although in some cases it could.This is a very handy little camera.  Nothing matches it in its price range and class, if you want more than this camera offers you will need to upgrade to a digital SLR.  The adjustable screen is incredibly useful, I didnt think I'd use it much but now find myself keeping this camera instead of upgrading to the SLR specifically so I can keep the adjustable screen.Warnings for new users out there:1. Following the lead of the rest of the Nikon family, this camera has a very slow autofocus.  On top of that, it is HORRIBLE to focus in low light.  Fortunately, most users of this type of camera are not taking night time candid or action photos, if you need to you will have to buy a SLR to get the performance you will need.  This camera is excellent for daylight and around the house photography.2. Make sure you buy a fast memory card.  If you buy a standard Compact Flash card you will be waiting up to a minute between photos while it saves if you use the higher resolution.  The card that comes with the camera only holds about 5 photos, so plan on buying a card with the camera.  3. The aftermarket lenses are horrible, do not buy unless you have tried them ahead of time and know what you are going to get for your money.4. Digital editing software that comes with the camera is not good for much, I'd recoment getting a better software package.
