        Very simple to use, not for the power user., January 7, 2009

This camera is the perfect point and shoot.  The menu's are extremely easy to use, the pictures come out very good and the camera will focus and shoot a picture faster than any camera I have ever used.  The drawbacks are the slow flash recharge time and the 3x optical zoom.  The screen is a good size, although the newer models have a slighly larger screen.  The memory slot will take a 16GB card.  I found this out after I bought it and was surprised to see at the highest resolution (8.0 megapixels) you get over 4500 pictures on a 16GB card.  Most people probably won't need more than a 4GB card for all their movies and pictures unless you aren't able to get to a computer for a VERY long time.  For the price (got mine for $150 on amazon) it is a really good deal for a mid-range economy camera.
