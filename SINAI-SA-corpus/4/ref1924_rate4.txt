        great camera, February 12, 2009

Since I have had 3 Pentax film cameras over the years (K1000, Me Super, and the Super Program), I had an investment in the K-mount lenses for them. This DSLR was the next logical step up for me, and I am very happy with this camera.  I have only had it for about a month, and I am still learning everything that this camera is capable of doing, but what I have learned and experimented with so far has been very good.  My old lenses work well with it (with manual focus of course).  It has produced some great pictures so far.  It seems the marketing trend now-a-days is go with either Nikon or Canon, and I am sure they have very good DSLRs too, but I am a loyal Pentaxian that is happy with this choice.
