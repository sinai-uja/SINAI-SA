        ByWildlife (Mass, USA)  - See all my reviews
Thing i like about this camera: Waterproof, tough, shiny, wide angle zoom. The picture quality is great after you get used to with difference the settings and shooting modes.  Drawbacks; LCD not as sharp and clear as Canon powershots, and its not made in Japan...I think Olympus 1030SW is the best waterproof, shockproof camera atm.
