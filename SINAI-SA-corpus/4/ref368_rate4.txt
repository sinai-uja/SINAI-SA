        great little camera, January 26, 2009
        Bylumpy "lumpy" (brooklyn)  - See all my reviews
my wife saw this on qvc and asked me to research on amazon (i researchevery product there) so after nearly 400 reviews (only about 10 were negative) this is a 2 way camera-meaning its for the pros or novice---my wife wanted a point  shoot,easy to hold,don't drain batteries. soafter a recent baby shower and 200 pictures a 1gb memory card and nimhbatties(2) she is estatic and comfortable and i am happy (she has her own camera for $104.+ free shipping from amazon..:) don't forget SANYO ENELOOPNIMH batteries-they don't drain. and a larger card (only comes with 32mg).qvc price was $149.+ ship
