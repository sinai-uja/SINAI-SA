        Almost perfect, April 26, 2003
        ByJ. Jarrett (Cullman, AL USA)  - See all my reviews
First off let me say that the camera is amazing.  The pictures are better than any digital pictures I have seen before.  I would have given this camera six stars if Nikon had done two things differently:1.  Put a bigger flash card with it.  They include a 16MB card with it.  That is a joke for a camera like this; they should have included at least a 64MB card.  I would recommend at least a 256MB card.  In RAW format your pictures are over 14MB!  I know not many people are going to take a 14MB picture; I like to use the fine setting, which averages out to about 1.5MB apiece.2.  The batteries stink.  They last about 90 mins which isn't that bad, what is so annoying is that they are not standard batteries.  Replacement batteries retail for about 50.  (Although Amazon sells them for much less.)  I want AA!!!  (They make an add-on that allows you to use AA but that will set you back a pretty penny too.)For as much money as this camera cost I would expect it to be a little more consumer friendly.  All in all it is a great camera and I would recommend purchasing to everyone.  Just keep in mind you will need to buy a larger flash card and at least one more battery.
