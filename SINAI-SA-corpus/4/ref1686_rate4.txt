This camera is the perfect all around camera with better than average image quality, durable housing, simple controls with the right depth of complexity for customizable images with great battery life.We took our camera on a cruise - this camera was perfect. Underwater, bouncing off the ground and then taking great shots moments thereafter ..could you ask for anything more?
