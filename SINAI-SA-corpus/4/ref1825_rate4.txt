Very nice camera, especially for just that price.With many convenient buttons that you can directly switch to the funtion you want, saved a lot from browsing and choosing from menu items.Just like *istDL, K110D and K100D, the white balance still not accurate. Mostly too yellowish, especially under tungsten lights. Sometimes even with customized WB still too much yellow that I have to remove it using software after shooting.
