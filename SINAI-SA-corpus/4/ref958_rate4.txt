        Great camera!  Get some extras though., January 9, 2009

I'm still learning more about the features of this camera.  For fast response, focus agility, and ease of use on top of that, it's great.  Battery lasts a good long time also.Minor complaints:  Standard SD card was 32MB.  I ran out of space after less than a dozen pictures!  Get a 1G or so when you buy this.Get a camera case.  The lens is protected when off, but I get the feeling it's too vulnerable for trouble without one.
