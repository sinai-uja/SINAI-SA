        ByLexie  - See all my reviews
I wanted a camera I couldn't break with my persistent clumsiness and bought this one on the recommendation of two friends.  I'm very pleased with its durability and general ease of use.  I'm not very techno-savvy, though, so a lot of my pictures in low light come out really fuzzy.  It might just be that I have it on some of the wrong settings, but it seems to me that I got better low-light pictures from my previous camera, which I broke by dropping too many times.  But I'm willing to concede that the problem might be me, not the camera.
