        Good DSLR, October 20, 2008
        ByY. Li (Gainesville, FL)  - See all my reviews
K10d is a really good camera. I tried Canon xt and xti before but both are small and don't fit my big hand. the size of K10d is alright! and it provided powerful manual adjustment for your catching pictures. The kit lens is also very good as basic lens.The Body SR function makes every lens perform very well when you hold it with shaky hands. I hate Canon and Nikon because they refuse to add Shake reduction function on the camera body so that they can sell SR lens at higher price.The only drawbacks low light performance is not as good as C and N. Focus speed is a little bid slow. Also the auto WB is not perfect. But you can adjust to get it right manually.Overall, it is a good DSLR.
