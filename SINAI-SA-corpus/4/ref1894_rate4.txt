        Great Camera, July 13, 2008
        ByT. Tolton (Yukon, OK)  - See all my reviews
I have had this camera just over 4 weeks and I love it.  I have always been a camera buff but the cost of film and processing restricted me.  With this camera you get instant feedback if your shot turned out.  I will never go back to film.The camera preforms like I expected.  I went with Pentax as my SLR is Pentax also and wanted to use my current lens.  I am glad I did.
