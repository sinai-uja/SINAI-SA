        bad delivery, nice camera, July 14, 2008
        ByDean Morris (NY NY)  - See all my reviews
My delivery from Amazon was fast at the best price anywhere, but the battery and memory card packages were flopping around in the box because it was inadequately packed and the corner was crushed -- luckily the camera seems to be ok. Let me jump ahead of myself to alert you: ***if the screen goes black when you turn the camera vertically, put your hand up to your ear and remove your polarized sunglasses!!!***The (reddish) brown is butt-ugly but reduces glare from around the viewfinder. The plastic doors are unimpressive, I hope they hold up. The buttons are simply arranged and well thought-out among monitor displays, menus, and functions. I wish the lens started out with a wider angle. The body size is nice and small, smaller than I expected from the product photo. Startup, shutter reponse, and recovery are still too slow. Movies are easy to shoot.Special-feature-wise you can easily set up color accent, color swap, sepia, dark or light skin tones and get obvious results. Other custom color settings changes are barely noticable. Stitching pictures that overlap in any way can be done in their verrrrry slooooow software. I often need to take two shots with different readings because the meter can't manage sky detail and shade detail in a single shot.
