        Nice camera, some slight issues, January 4, 2009
        ByGood Gracia (Upper Michigan)  - See all my reviews
My son bought this camera for me this Christmas and I'm still learning how to use it, but I'll do some pros and cons here:Pros:  View finder, large LCD screen, great macro setting, nice size with hand grip.Cons:  Long delays between shots, grainy at long range, flash too bright, no neck strap.I really like the feel of this camera, and I love the view finder, but overall it's a step down from my present camera.  I have a Konica Minolta Dimage Z20, 5 megapixels and 8X optical.  I love that camera but it's too bulky to take everywhere.  It doesn't have the image stabilizer but it seems to take clearer pictures than the Canon does.  However, the macro on the Canon is much better than the KM, and that's important to me.I'm really concerned with the long delay between shots, and if anyone can tell me how to fix this, I would appreciate it.  I'm not especially techno-savvy and that thick manual is pretty intimidating! (But at least it comes with a manual.)
