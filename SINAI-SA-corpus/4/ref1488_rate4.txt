        Great, but some limitations, May 5, 2003
        By A Customer
This is my first digital camera, having used multiple Nikon film cameras over 40 years. The camera has four limitations: 1) in indoor lighting, autofocus hunts and hunts; 2) steep learning curve with a BIG manual REQUIRED reading; 3) no filters possible? VERY Strange; 4) proprietary battery, whose life with autofocus and fill-in speedlight available runs 30-40 minutes.Output quality even at normal setting is superb. With enough time and effort I'm confident I'll master the WEALTH of possibilities, but it is a complicated camera if one wishes to master the variety of options. Easy to use at auto-everything setting. Lots more control possible with various User Settings 1, 2, or 3. I'd recommend one or more 512 high-speed Compact Flash cards as a minimum, unless you stay mighty close to your computer, and I'd get at least three additional Nikon batteries. With time and effort, I've grown to love it, but it's not easy for a digital newbie. Expect to spend a LOT of time in a complicated menu system and a LOT of time with your nose in the rather poorly written manual.For a MUCH better manual, buy Dennis P. Curtin's Short Course in  Nikon CoolPix 5700 Photography. The printed format is BW, but the included CD allows one to print the whole manual in color [.pdf file] and/or a 14-page cheat sheet that greatly simplifies the confusing controls on this VERY capable camera.LATER: After 13 months with this camera, I continue to find GREAT picture quality, but will trade it for an 8700 in order to get a decent autofocus. We tried taking baby pictures in indoor lighting and it was simply hopeless. The AF essentially gives up in low lighting ... a stupid design flaw, as is the lack of easy use of filters and a complex set buttons, wheels, switches, etc. In decent lighting this is an EXTREMELY capable camera, with gorgeous output. For very little more the 8700 is far more capable of working in a low-light environment.
