        coolpix:  cool  pix- for real, July 4, 2003
        ByJ L. Simmons (KY United States)  - See all my reviews
I am strictly an amateur, but wanted to make the switch from 35mm to digital. Tight budget.  Friends let me borrow their Kodak EasyShare (3.0meg) and a 4 meg Olympus, and they were "OK."  I was not going to spend the extra $$$ on the 5700.  Then I read all the reviews of the Coolpix 5700 on Amazon and also the article on it in Consumer Reports/Online.  Consumer Reports gave it a top rating, and everyone else raved about it. I thought it was too good to be true.  Believe what you read.  I am an amateur, but in about 15 minutes after taking it out of the box, I was making great pictures; even up to full-size enlargments.  Warning: everyone else is right about the low-light problem. The camera is just not sure what to do in very low light.  That's why I gave it only 4 stars.  However, when you have 5 megapixels you are in digital heaven.  Clarity, color, flexibility, color copies, people tell me that I am making stuff like a professional.  A 256 flashcard is all I need.  You can choose your photo quality, and even change quality settings between pictures. The adjustable LCD is versatile and helps a lot. I usually use the 3mg setting.  I shoot all day, store it, and start all over again.  I used the 5meg. setting on some wildflowers, and made a 14X20 enlargement.  Crystal clear, you can practically see the pollen.  Save your pennies and go for this one.  PS:  I also got the wideangle lens, but the 5700 is so versatile, you can easily live without it.
