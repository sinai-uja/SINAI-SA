This is a terrific entry-level camera.  It takes excellent pictures and has many convenient features.  It's a great camera to take on trips etc and is small and light and quite easy to use.  The pics taken with the digital zoom are a bit grainy so I don't take pictures with the digital zoom.  The 3X optical zoom is a little weak but common for this category.  For the price it is definitely a bargain and I would recommend it.
