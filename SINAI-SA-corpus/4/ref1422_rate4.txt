        A good camera, January 10, 2006
        BySamuel A. Patlove  - See all my reviews
This is my first digital camera so I don't have much to compare to. I do know what I want though and researched for awhile before deciding on the Z740, mainly due to the balance of price and features.My only complaints and the reason I don't give this product 5 stars are the lack of manual focus and the fact that the lens cap comes off way too easily. Otherwise, very happy!
