Good product; dad likes it; dunno much about cameras but he can re-use all the old pentax lenses that he had with his 'film' camera.Easy to start using ....we'll know more later as the usage ramps up.Kinda cheap that they dont sell the memory card and camera bag all in one package....and you have to separately buy and pay for each shipping.
