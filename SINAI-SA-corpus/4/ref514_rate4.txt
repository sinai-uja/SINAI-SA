        Nice!, July 18, 2007
        ByCharles B. Summers (Nashville, TN United States)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera after breaking my Nikon Coolpix P2 which I LOVED. I was well pleased with the quality of pictures that the Nikon made, so I knew it was going to be hard to replace.A lot of research later, I found the Canon A630. I like the large LCD screen and what was even better was the fact that it would fold shut, or rotate so that even I could get into a shot once in a while. Even better than that is the picture quality... I have a picture of a plane towing a glider, and when enlarged you can actually see the tow line. The reason I gave it four stars is this camera doesn't have the rechargable battery pack that I liked so well with the Nikon. Also, the memory card slot is in the same door as the four AA-batteries and I usually end up spilling my batteries when getting the card out. Not really a big deal now after owning this camera awhile... but I would have preferred somewhere else.
