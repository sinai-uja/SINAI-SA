        ByBrijesh Paliwal  - See all my reviews
I purchased a Canon A590 Power shot digital camera. Camera was superb and the results are superb even video quality is awesome.BUT THE CAMERA I GOT FROM AMAZON IS OPEN IT WAS NOT PACKED LOOKS LIKE SOME BODY HAS RETURNED IT. I NEVER HEARD THIS FROM ANY BODY THAT AMAZON CAN DO THIS. BUT THAT WAS MY FIRST AND LAST PURCHASE FROM AMAZON. I STOPPED AFTER THAT. SO PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS.
