I really have enjoyed this camera because of all the settings that it has. It has all the basic settings a casual photographer needs for every-day pictures, but also includes color-swapping and a great macro setting that are great for people more into taking photos as a hobby. It even suits the professional because you can buy and add other lenses for the camera to make the pictures you take more beautiful.
