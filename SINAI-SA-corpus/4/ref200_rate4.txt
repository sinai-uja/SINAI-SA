        Canon PowerShot A590IS, February 18, 2009
        ByK. Ochiai  - See all my reviews
I had the previous version, the A570IS, but it mysteriously refused to download pics from the camera after only a year.It also started to drain the batteries at an alarming rate.I replaced it with the A590IS, which is the new version of the A570IS.Buttons and controls are identical, except it's in black instead of silver.However, the A590IS takes much sharper, clearer pictures, and the macro mode works much better; no more blurry close ups like the A570IS.Shot time using the flash is also dramatically improved over the A570IS.I just hope this one lasts more than a year.
