Good Camera, This is my first Digital... From 35mm I waited to get his model. Worth the wait... The battery seems to not last that long always have a spare on hand. Also get the Camera Fire Wire USB Wire. It communicates great with a touch of a button to the PC. I have a Dell-P3 600 and it works fin with my USB Port.Support Kodak, Thank you from Rochester NY
