        Great camera -- a bit bulky, though, December 21, 2006

This camera is amazing -- great shutter response time, excellant battery life, and tons of features and completley customizable.  However, it was so bulky, we often just left it at home, rather that take it with us to parties.  The same convenience of being able to use AA's (and not worrying about charging the camera, or having it die halfway through your trip) also results in a substantial bulk.  Also, the camera does not accomodate one-handed operation.  If portability is not a concern -- go for it.  It is infinitely tweakable -- with a full manual mode and lots of creative options.  But if you are looking for a point and shoot you can drop in your purse, or even your pocket, go for the SD630.
