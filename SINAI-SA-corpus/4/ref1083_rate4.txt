        Perfect Easy-to-Use, Compact Camera, November 24, 2008

I bought this camera to take on short trips when my DSLR is too bulky. For me, image quality in a camera like this is less important than ease of use and sheer portability.This PowerShot is exactly what I wanted in a camera like this. The images are nice, the camera is quite small and very light. It is just small enough to comfortably fit into the front pocket of my jeans. The flash and zoom aren't perfect, but this IS a point and shoot camera. I don't have any complaints about the photos from this camera. The rechargeable battery is great and charges quickly. My previous point-and-shoot had a terrible shutter delay. This camera does a nice job of taking the image right when I press the button. It's not quite as responsive as my DSLR, but still very good.This one does take short movies, but the quality is not great. Don't buy this thinking you're going to take lots of home movies. It's good in a pinch or to capture something random, otherwise, skip the movie feature.Recommended for the family on the go.
