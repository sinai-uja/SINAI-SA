        Pentax K200D, June 18, 2008
        ByMichael Dotson (AL USA)  - See all my reviews
I used Pentax cameras years ago and this is my first use of the digital SLR type camera.  It performed admirably on my recent trip to Puerto Rico handling a wide range of really up close stuff as well as some panaramic type photos.  As usual for Pentax, my old lenses worked, just not in auto focus.  I am a manual camera lover and for this camera to meet my standards suprised me.  It gives the user lots of flexibility and different modes by which you can control the photos.
