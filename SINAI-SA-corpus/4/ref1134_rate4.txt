        Great Camera for the Price!, June 1, 2005
        ByHIPPY MAC  - See all my reviews
I just brought this camera a few weeks ago.  I took it on a trip this Memorial weekend and the pictures came out beautiful.  I love the close-up mode and the sports mode the best.  The night mode is also very good (which surprised me).  I also like the fact that this camera allows you to review the pictures and zoom in and out when doing so. I did not like the auto mode at all.  The landscape mode took pretty good pictures.  When I viewed them I thought they weren't good, but when I reviwed them online they were beautiful like postcards.I also like the video capability.  When I first got the camera, I did a little home video walking around the house and talking and when I uploaded it on the computer it was sharp and very clear.  It also played back well on the camera.  This camera is worth the price.  Like the other reviewers I recommend any buyer to purchase rechargeable batteries.
