        Can't get more camera than this, October 13, 2008
        ByHan Jen Kwang  - See all my reviews
Real value for money camera. A light, "small" compact that gives me some control on exposure when I'm too lazy to lug around the DSLR.Pros----1. View finder - saves battery life2. AA batteries - no extra camera specific charger; easy to find batteries in emergencies3. quite small - still fits in a jacket/Bermudas pocket 4. Manual/Av/Tv controls5. Cheap Cons----1. Av does not blur background much - since sensor size, distance to lens is different from DSLRs, its effectively like 4 to 5x the aperture value. (ie. at widest of f2.6, its more like f13 or more.... )The background just does not blur out unless its quite far from the subject.2. 35mm at widest and not 28mm which would be ideal.
