        ByR. Kirkham "jrkirkham" (Rushville, Illinois USA)  - See all my reviews
I've photographed weddings and like to play with special features on my cameras.  This unit has enough gadgets to impress me.  I am also impressed by it's workmanship.My wife likes to just point and shoot.  She is a teacher and likes to keep the docking printer in her classroom.  The camera is simple enough for her needs, yet has a better quality picture than some of the other cheaper models we looked at.I looked a long time for a low cost easy to use camera with more advanced features than normal.  I'm not sorry I chose this one.
