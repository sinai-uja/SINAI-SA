        Great camera, January 24, 2007
        Byszelivia (Morton Grove, IL)  - See all my reviews
I was pleasant surprised with K10D as it combines built-in image stabilization, self-cleaning sensor, easy-to-use image controls and sealed body. It's just fills right in my hands. I'm not going to repeat all good pints that can be found in previous reviews. But I want to comments on some "Cons". Yang from MI point out that: "10M is not much bigger than 6M (*ist DL), it is good to have but don't expect a big difference..." More pixels isn't give you better image. You wouldn't see a difference on 5X6 or 8X10 in print. But if you want to print 24X36 in print this when you need more pixels. Overall it's a GREAT camera and a big step forward from istDS/K100 series cameras. I like that K10 has more controls on the body that before was bared in menus. I like RAW button big time.  What hold me from give K10D five stars it's AF. Even AF much improved from DS still not as fast as Nikon D70S. Highly recommended.
