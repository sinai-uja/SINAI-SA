        good things in small packages, December 6, 2008
        ByA. Tolman "Andy in ME" (Maine)  - See all my reviews
This generation Elph has hit a sweet spot: it's about as small as it can get and still have usable controls, and it's minimized some of the limitations of earlier generations: much less shutter lag, and snapshot focus is better with face detection.  It takes remarkably good pictures in available light, and is better than most of its size at managing the flash, so that interiors don't look as artificial. It doesn't replace my D-80 for serious photography, but having something that fits in a shirt pocket means getting shots at times when you're not out on a dedicated photography mission. Excellent value.
