The good: I bought this camera for it's excellent price and brand name association. It's a great camera on the go. Takes AA batteries (get rechargeable for extended shooting time) a big plus in my needs. Takes incredible sunset pictures, indoor pictures,  Landscapes, movies are excellent too. Most all pictures turn out great nearly every time. IS is a bonus for the price. The limitations: Longer than normal cycle time when taking flash photos or outdoor bright photos. Macro leaves much to be desired. Other Canon point and shoot cameras have amazing macro ability. This camera does not. Zoom function while nice has a tendency to introduce blur with or without the IS on. Overall, I love this camera. For the price and it's multitude of functions and the easy mode which is perfect for those who just want to turn on a camera and take great pics, this is a perfect camera. Note: I have taken over 4,000 pictures with this camera. And take it with me everywhere.
