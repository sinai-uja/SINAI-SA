        Bulletproof Camera, Great Pix and Video, Mixed Programming, April 1, 2008
        ByMark Lee (Woodruff, UT USA)  - See all my reviews
Our county bought a pile of these great cameras along with 1GB memory cards and we've been using them for a year now.  This is a tough digital with a bright display that you can pull out and flip around if you want.  The high-res video mode is 640x480 and smooth.  We bought them for use by law enforcement, fire and ambulance crews because the controls are large and easily manipulated by people under a bit of stress.  The USB2 cable connection is fast and the transfer software is acceptable, even if it's not terribly pretty.  The software stores your photos in dated folders, so make sure you've set up your camera properly.  One of our folks had a bunch of photos end up in a folder dated "1980" which appears to be the blank date setting.  I carry mine with an extra four AA batteries (yup, four) because you don't get much warning when they go.  But as a general rule, the camera's not a battery hog either.  The macro and exposure adjustment setting work pretty darn well.I've dumped this camera a number of times and keeps on ticking.  It's *not* a professional camera for those who are hypercritical, but what it does, it does very well and while I usually use this camera for work, the few private photos I've put up in blogs are of very good quality and usually get comments.
