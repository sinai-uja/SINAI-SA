        No USB cord!, March 16, 2005

This is an amazing camera, which really takes great photos.  The 10X optical zoom is excellent.  The quality of the prints are great too. However, be aware that when ordered with the printer docking station, a USB cord to connect your camera directly to your computer is NOT included.  Kodak includes a USB cord to connect the printer to the computer, but who wants to carry the printer everywhere.  I called Kodak and apparently they want to charge $14.95 for the cord.
