        Awesome design, less than stellar performance/user, April 25, 2008

I love the ruggedness of this camera.  it is very solid and feels much better in hand than at least the Cannon Rebel Digital.  It is heavier but I like that.The features and functions are great.  This is my first DSLR and I am by no means even a novice photographer.  The main reason for the purchase was to get better night time pictures since the Point and Shoot cameras do such a horrible job, but this does not do a better job with the built in flash.  I imagine getting a good flash for it will make a huge difference.I paid extra to get this camera over Cannon and Nikon of similar pixel because it comes with much better features overall, so price per function/feature is much better IMHO.  I have NOT experienced the blurriness that other users talk about with the JPG pictures, but I have noticed that the pictures in general are not as bright as should be.There are alot of postings on how to change the settings to fix that but I have not tried it yet.No regrets...specially since the price has been going up since I bought it.
