This camera is exactly as advertised.  Snaps a photo when you press the shutter button, no waiting, sometimes that split second makes you miss a shot. Not to worry with this camera. The charging unit is nice and small will be easy to take on vacation. If you want a camera that will do it all for the price, this is the one.  I know two other people who own this camera and they also love it.  Highly recommmended.
