Well it is a lot of camera for the bucks and i like it except had I to do over i would have opted for the 10MP (A640) version because with the 10MP you can do remote exposure you cannot with this camera also if in movie mode the camera has an annoying (& very disappointing) high pitched "camera sound" which although not screaming loud is audible enough especially on quiet footage that is a shade or two above noticeable .  There are features on this model which sometimes get in the way & are all too easy to set unintentionally, I am speaking of the color selector which is a very cool feature,,  but can be tripped when you do not want or need the feature.  The Picture quality is beyond decent for the price. The integrated software "Image Browser" has been tricky for me switching from stills to video clips when uploading. Clips in low light are better than most cameras.The macro functions of the camera especially for movie clips is brilliant and deserve high praise. The swing out screen is an awesome feature for being able to see the screen way below or overhead, it is a well designed feature and often will cause interest from those around you @ events. Although having experienced the Elph series I thought this would be a good choice & overall it's a fairly good camera and an excellent value.overall 8 out of 10 would be my rating.
