I love my new camera.  I am not, by any means, a professional but it does everything I wanted it to do.  I carry it with me all the time because it is so small and lightweight.  I took it kayaking and got some great photos and did not have to worry about it getting wet.  I also took it to an amusement park and on all the water rides.  I live in a wooded area with a lot of wildlife.  I have been able to get some awesome photos of the deer through windows from inside the house so as not to scare them.  Yes it does have one issue, you have to be careful not to put fingers in front of the shutter, but that's easy to learn.  I am very happy with my purchase.
