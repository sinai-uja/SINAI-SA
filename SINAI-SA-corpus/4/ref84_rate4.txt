        Wonderful Gift, January 18, 2009

I bought this camera [[ASIN:B0011ZCDKS Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom] for Christmas and it has all the functions I was looking for. The shutter speed is a little slow compared to some cameras in the same price range but after some adjusting in the menu, it can be compensated for. The menu interface is very user friendly after a quick glance through of the manual (which in all honesty does look like a small dictionary and reads like one too.) With a decent size memory card (2Gb and up) the capture video time was greatly increased. Great price, shipping was fast and price was very fair. I have already recommended this product to a few friends and we will be using it anywhere, anytime!
