        Kodak Z740 Digital Camera Review, October 2, 2005

I have had the camera for about one month and am quite pleased. It is my first digital camera but most of the functions are quite intuitive. There are two areas which are less than they could be: (1) the LCD screen is fixed; infrequently, it would be helpful if it could be pivoted due to light conditions, etc. and (2) the joystick takes some getting used to when processing settings under the menu. Both of these are minimized with experience. One last thing is the minimal picture size of 1.8 MP; this requires a filesize in excess of 450 KB to email a jpg image.
