        Excellent for the price, December 30, 2008
        ByK. J. Lehman (Chicago IL)  - See all my reviews
I'm not the most technical person so keep that in mind =)I bought this camera to replace out 5 year old Kodak EasyShare DX4530. It was dropped one too many times and gave up. I would rate that camera as a 5 star (non professional) camera as a comparison.I did not want to spend a lot and the reviews and price on this camera were good. I have had it for a couple months and have been pleased. The pictures, for the most part, turn our very nice. There are many options for picture taking ie...kidspets, portrait, action, etc. and other setting to play with if you know what they mean or do. I mostly keep it on auto. Low light picture taking is difficult. The flash is VERY bright so if you want mood lighting (taking a pic of kids blowing out candles) you are out of luck! The flash tends to wash things out, especially if you are a little close. The contrast in pictures is something I regularly have to fix with photo editing software. I sometimes also have to fix the definition as pictures sometimes come out soft. I have had an issue with odd reddish shadows once in a while but I'm not sure why. Zooming in on things makes them a bit grainy. The video feature is great! You would not want to use the camera as a video camera but if you need to catch that spontaneous moment, it will do. The camera itself seems sturdy. The rubbery plastic door that closes over the USB port is the only part I'm concerned about breaking. For a small camera it is pretty heavy. If you want something to slip into your jeans this is probably not the right camera. It is perfect for a small purse though. It is small in length and height but it is pretty wide because of the battery compartment.For the price, and as an everyday camera, I am very happy.
