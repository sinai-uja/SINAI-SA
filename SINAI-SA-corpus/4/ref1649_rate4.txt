        Very Well Built - Great for Hiking and Beach, March 28, 2008
        ByK. Howard (Honolulu, HI USA)  - See all my reviews
I received this camera a few days ago and have been putting it through it's paces.  I live in Hawaii, so have been using it while at the beach and free diving.  For me, this is an ideal point and shoot camera.I feel that the image quality is great.  I may not have a very good eye to judge this, but my experience says that most cameras produce good images when used correctly.  Poor images are more due to the user than the camera.  I was impressed with the menu controls and how much explanation is on the camera itself (I especially like the on camera guide).  Compared to my other cameras (Canon SD600 and Sony DCR-PC350 video camera with 3 MP still support) the menu system is much improved and easier to use.  This is my first Olympus camera, so I can't compare it too prior models.  I really like how I can use the full auto feature for simplicity, but the camera can guide me through more detailed situations using either the scene menu or the guide.Physically, I was impressed with this camera.  It is rather heavy, but feels very solid.  For the first time, I feel like I can take a camera anywhere with little worries.  I already dropped it on a hike in some mud and just pored some water on it and kept shooting.  This, to me, is well worth the slight price premium for this camera.  I simply couldn't get these pictures before without an expensive housing.  The dial on the back of the camera is difficult to use, but a minor inconvenience.I was rather impressed with the in camera panoramic function.  If you take your time, it can give you good results.
