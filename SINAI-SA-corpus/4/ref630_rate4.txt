        Nice camera, November 6, 2007

This is a nice camera but I would have never bought it had I not dropped my Powershot A80 on the driveway.  This new camera does take nice pictures but I think the "Auto" setting is not nearly as good as what my A80 had.  When I don't feel like using the manual settings I more often get disappointed with the picture.  Mainly they look washed out and drab.  The A80 did a much better job when you want to be lazy.I will say I have some very nice pictures with this camera when using the manual modes (and some with "Auto").  The video is nice and looks pretty good when hooked up to a standard CRT TV.  I picked this camera because the viewfinder folds open and swivels around.  This is nice when holding the camera over my head and adjust the viewfinder so I can still see my target.
