        Great Camera - Buy from Amazon!, January 9, 2009
        ByL. Sommerville (IN)  - See all my reviews
I haven't had much time with this camera, but have researched many and this seems to be the best compact buy without sacrifising image quality. I have an A610 as well as a Rebel XT and love picture quality, ease of use, and affordability with Canon cameras. My A610 is great and takes wonderful pictures, minus the lens error I got with it, luckily Canon fixed for me, but I know others were not as lucky. I did have to have the first SD1100 that I was sent replaced b/c the lens sounded like it was catching and I did not want to chance it. I returned it with no problem and no charge. Amazon was out of stock, but I still received a new camera within TWO days of processing my return online. Amazon had overnighted it to me within one day of getting it in stock, no charge. The noise is less noticeble on this one. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING IT FROM AMAZON; CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EXCEPTIONAL.For Now here is my opinion.Pros:MOST IMPORTANTLY: Takes vibrant/ crisp picturesEasy to UseAuto Red EyeImage StabilizationFace DetectionCompact and LightweightBattery- I like not having the weight of regular batteriesVERY AFFORDABLE (Compare to what you would get in other brands- compact)Cons:I compared it to my 610 and it seems like it does cast a warmer tone to  white and skin tones, but not extremely noticebleBattery life could be betterZoom and shutter a little noisy (might just be the sound it is supposed to make)Flash Recycle time a bit slow QUESTION:  I would like to know is if the slightly static noise when zooming and pressing the shutter is universal. I will prob try one in store to make sure. For now I will give 4 stars.
