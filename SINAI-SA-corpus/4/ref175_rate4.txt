        Highly Recommend, November 26, 2008

This is a nice camera, especially for the price.  It does everything that I need it to do:  auto focus/flash, zoom...It uses AA batteries which is a plus in my book because I don't like having to recharge batteries (or buy replacement rechargables).  Since AA batteries are available everywhere, I never have to worry about battery levels.  Cameras that use AAs are usually a little larger than those with the small rechargable batteries, but it is worth a little extra bulk in my opinion.  I bought a large memory card for it so I can take hundreds of photos.  I highly recommend this camera!
