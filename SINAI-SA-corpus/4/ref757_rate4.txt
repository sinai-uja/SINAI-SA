        Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Review, February 12, 2009

I use the Canon Powershot SD1100IS for birding - held up to my 20x scope/tripod or 10x binoculars, otherwise the 3x zoom is of rather minimal use. So far I've found it to be adequate to the task though the ability to attach an adapter would be helpful.  I shoot at raw power to allow for image enlargement if necessary and the pictures are good.  The most important charateristic for my purposes are size (ease of carrying), image quality, video capability, and price.  This product fills the bill.  For a more extensive review check CNET.
