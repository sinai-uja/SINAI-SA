        Awesome Pics, Slow Flash, December 20, 2008

For a point and shoot, you can't beat the value on this Canon.  It is intuitive to use, has an "easy" setting, and produces great resolution in the photos.  My wife (not mechanically inclined) is able to take photos that rival professional quality.  The video function works great, and you can even zoom while filming, something our previous camera wouldn't do.  The only drawback is the long wait for the flash to reset, but that is offset by being able to use rechargeable AA batteries.  Would highly recommend this camera.  My mom is buying one for my dad this Christmas.
