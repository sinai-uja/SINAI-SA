        Nice Camera, but not for the weak at heart., November 1, 2002

The Nikon 5700 is one of the better ones you'll find around the thousand dollar mark, but it is not a point and shoot consumer camera. There are some problems in low light conditions if you keep everything on auto, but with numerous user settings you can program the camera itself to perform very well. I do find the icons somewhat cryptic and the LCD is too small. If you are an inexperienced photgrapher and don't know anything about aperture and shutter control you might want to look at the Sony F717. The complaints about the autofocus are unfounded. The autofocus is slow, but in most cases the problems are with the inexperience of the user, or maybe they just didn't read the manual. If you want an inexpensive creative tool, buy this camera. If you want something to take family pics on your vacation and are not interested in serious photography, don't waste your money.
