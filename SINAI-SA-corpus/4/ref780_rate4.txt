        Great little camera for point and shoot with extras, January 12, 2009
        ByEdward Vawter (Salem, OR USA)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this particular Canon camera because I already had extra batteries and other stuff for a old SD300 camera and this uses the same battery.  It takes great photos and has all the bells and whistles that are common to digital compact cameras these days.  We had a snow storm shortly after I received the camera and so got it use the snow setting and it works great giving fairly accurate colors without being over exposed due to the snow.I have shot about 200 photos thus far and am very happy with the camera.
