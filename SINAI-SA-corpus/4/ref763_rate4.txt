Great camera.  Small size makes sure you take it with you to actually capture moments.  Have had numerous digital and SLR cameras in the past and found no matter how great the camera was, if it was too large or a hassle to carry I would often leave it home and miss moments and great shots.  This solves that and is really easy to use.  Great for hiking/take anywhere camera.  Small size may be a little hard for larger hands.  I have large hands and can maneuver it pretty well but have to focus more on what I'm pressing.  Definetly worth the trade-off for the size.  Pictures are fantastic, definetly excels at Macro shots.  Amazing quality and ability to capture detail up close.  General and landscape/scenic photos it does OK.  Pictures of people it does great.  If you are on the fence buy this camera!  It's worth it and Amazon by far has the best price.
