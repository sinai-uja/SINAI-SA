        Great camara. . . but could be better, September 20, 2008
        ByFrancisco Martinz Martos "Frank1306" (Mad, Spain)  - See all my reviews
Everything about the camara is as described , but the quality of photos done in dark conditions is not as good as other similar camaras (eg canon, panasonic..) which lack the water and shock proof features. . .But overall very happy with it and would recommend it... may be in the near future Canon or Panasonic will go for those features and then.. will see.
