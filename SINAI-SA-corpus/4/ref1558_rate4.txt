        Takes excellent pictures, February 28, 2006

I had a Coolpix 5700 for a little over a year and was very satisfied with the pictures it takes. I would advice owners to definitely read the manual. You should also get an external flash. This will do wonders for your pictures in low light settings. I only sold my camera because I purchased a Canon dSLR. The Nikon's zoom capability, quality pictures, and many manual functions are excellent, but you must read the manual to take advantage of the camera.
