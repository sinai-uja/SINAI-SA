Big step up from my Sony Cybershot!  I had to read the manual just to figure out how to review the pictures I had taken.  Once I started learning how to use this camera I was amazed at how beautiful the pictures came out.  This not only a great camera but a great price too!!  I highly recommend this camera.  The only downfall about this camera is the size.  I would prefer to have a slimmer pocket size but my main focus is the picture quality.
