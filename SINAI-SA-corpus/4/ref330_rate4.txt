        Great Little Camera, January 14, 2009

I am an old film guy who scoffed at digital but decided to buy this camera for my wife because of its "point and shoot" capabilities.  The pictures she took on a recent vacation turned out great, and those that didn't resulted from operator error.  For those of us who feel compelled to impose our "artistic" selves upon the photos we take, this little camera has enough controls to satisfy.  The photo stabilization feature is great for those of us whose hands are not very stabilized any longer. It is also small, unobtrusive and light weight. Not a big old brick hanging on a string around your neck!  I recommend  this camera to just about any one who is at the beginner/intermediate level and want to create some very nice photos
