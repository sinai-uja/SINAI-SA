I have this camera.  Its very useful to take short movies and the picture clarity is very good.  The USB option make its very easy for transefering the photos on to your PC and delete the pics that you dont like.  The only thing i dislike is that batteries wont last for long.  They would go out say in couple of hours.  Overall the performance is good.
