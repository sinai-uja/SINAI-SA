We had Cannon S2S which had water spalsh and stopped working.We were in a kind of hurry for our big holiday and decided to get this camera after reading some reviews in Amazon. They were helpful.This camera has clarity,good audio and nice features.The camera is good and meets the expectations.Good product for the price that is offered.Amazon's prompt delivery helped us capture the beautiful moments.
