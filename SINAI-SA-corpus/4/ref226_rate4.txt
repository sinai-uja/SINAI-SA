        Canon PowerShot A590 IS, December 29, 2008
        ByDaniel R. Najuch "Dan N." (New York, USA)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this camera to replace my 3-year-old Konica/Minolta Dimage 6.  The Konica had a 12X optical zoom, one of the reasons I purchased it in the first place.  But the 12X optical zoom made the camera a little bulky.  Too bulky to slip into my coat pocket or a small carrying case.  Because of that, I found myself taking fewer and fewer photos.  Enter the Canon PowerShot A590 IS.  So far, I am totally happy with this camera.  First of all, its size is perfect for me.  It fits neatly into a coat pocket, or sometimes into even my pants pocket.  Though it only has a 4X optical zoom, its 8MP ability allows me to PhotoShop the scenes I can't zoom in on enough with very little loss of resolution.  I take the majority of my photos at the 5MP setting.  At this setting, with a 4 Gb card, I can store over 2700 photos.  The color settings are great too.  I have the options of B/W, sepia, neutral, vivid, and custom.  And the vivid setting lives up to its meaning; the colors just pop!  I also chose this camera because of the shutter and aperture priority settings; I like to make my own settings on occasion.  Most of the compact digitals out there now no longer allow that.  But it still has enough presets for those who don't want to fiddle...full auto, easy, program, portrait, landscape, night snapshot, kids  something else one doesn't see much any more.  It may seem a bit old-fashioned, but when the sun is at your back and you're trying to frame your subject, and the view screen becomes useless, you'll be very glad you have a viewfinder.  All in all, a great little camera; well worth the money.  I absolutely recommend this camera.  I've heard a rumor that Canon has discontinued this model, so get one while you still can.
