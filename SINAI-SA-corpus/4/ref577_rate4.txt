        Good value, lots of image noise in evening indoor photos, poor quality flash, November 21, 2006

My wife upgraded from her old Olympus 3030 and wow were we disappointed with this camera! Low light image noise was an order of magnitude worse than the old Olympus, and the flash was nowhere near as even as the older camera. Even though Canon has made this a fairly easy to use camera, my wife still goes back to Olympus. That being said, the camera is only $250, so we were probably expecting too much. I own a Canon 30D SLR and several lenses, so I don't have a thing against Canon. The 30D is an incredible semi-pro camera that I highly recommend if you don't mind the bulk and price of an SLR.
