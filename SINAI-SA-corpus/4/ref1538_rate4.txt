I bought this camera after many years of owning a Nikon FM-2.This camera and those like it fill a gap for those who do not want to invest in a Digital SLR system. Yet have some control over the camera.If you can get by with 5 Megapixles this is a good camera.If you can, buy the filter set and the adapter because it not only protects the lens but also protects the zoom mechanism.Buy or find the MB-E5700 battery pack which letts you use 6 AA Lithium batteries or rechargables. This gives you the best power option. (Turn off the continuous Autofocus and you will save power galore!)No serious photographer uses on camera flash. You can turn off the flash on the camera and get a Speedlight.The camera takes a while to master if you want to use all the features.The metering for exposures is near perfect. The problems in low light can be overcome with some simple steps.Set the focus on infinity for long distances shots.Use the focus lock to lock onto something with contrast in low light situations. This is the camera's Achilles heel.The Camera in not a pro camera and will take time to shoot download hi-res photos to memory. I have been very pleased with camera and the results. I would like to have a Nikon D200 but do not want to spend that much.
