I bougth a SD1000 last year for my wife, but our daugther basically take it for herself, so I need to buy another camera for my disatisfied wife. I was happy with the SD1000, so I choose this model thinking it will be more of the same, an I like the new colors too.After some weeks of use, I could say that this is a better camera, it feels more solid, with better materials. The photos are better, not only because of the IS, but with the overall quality (I have made some prints and I think all photos look better).I don't give it 5 stars because of the limited manual controls. It is a very good, may I say excelent, point and shoot, but if your'e interested in experimenting with your photos, you may want to buy another model with more manual controls.
