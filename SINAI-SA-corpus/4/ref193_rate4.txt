I bought this camera as gift for a family member. The person loves the camera and from the reviews I read online at such places as cnet.com this camera is a decent camera and its available at a good price (when I got it is ~$100). If you simply looking to get a camera for a family member that doesn't know all the fancy features then I suggest this camera plus it has Image Stabilization. Please look at the other reviews to get a better assessment of this camera for your own purposes.
