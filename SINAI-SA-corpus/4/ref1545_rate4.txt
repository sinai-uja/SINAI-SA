owed Nikon 35 mm cameras in the past, and for the $$ this is the best going, pic quality great, takes some learning, but the video if u can. may great features, only problem i found was the lack of a lens thread that would take filters, this is easly solved by many aftermarket suppliers. get an extra battery. resoultion is as good as any 35mm camera up to 16X20. light weight and extremly well built, but again, does have a learning curve. and also loved the 60sec video. great for vacations. impressed with the quality in relation to the D series cameras. best value for the money....
