        It does the job well, November 27, 2008

I won't go over all the points & features others have already covered well. So I'll just quickly note I am very happy with this camera. It doesn't have the best lens by any means or the strongest zoom, but it is amazingly waterproof.  We used it in the ocean snorkeling as well as in the pool taking various shots and videos. Worked like a charm.  You do have to play with the numerous settings and modes to get some pictures to look just right -- especially in lowlight situations. (Daylight pictures were no problem.)  I found some night pics didn't always come out so well and it was very much a matter of trial & error to get them to work, so be sure to practice before trying to take pictures of an important event, trip or moment. Also the flash is not the strongest either so be sure your main subject(s) are fairly close and pretty much forget about the background showing up if it's any real distance away.  The panorama function worked really well in just about every situation and the camera can even stitch the images together for you itself and you can see the results in a few seconds.The camera fits nicely in the pocket of your shirt or pants. The charger will charge the battery fully in about an hour or so.  We also bought the orange flotation strap which did keep the camera from sinking in water.  It's a good, solid all purpose camera which we had a lot of fun using.
