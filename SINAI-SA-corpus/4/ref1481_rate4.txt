The 8x zoom and 5 megapixels finally lured me from film about 6 months ago. I am a nature/landscape photographer using medium and large format, and gave up my 35mm equipment a few years ago. I just came back from a month long trip to the Antarctic, and the prints I've made from the Nikon are sharp,in focus, and colorful. Plusses: very good lens, great zoom, excellent meter compensation for different light levels (think ice); good color balance; good beginner photo software;a heckuva lot lighter than a view camera.  Minuses: shutter lag is annoying for action shots; forget the digital zoom; automatic preview gets in the way of repeated shots (can be overridden); buy an extra battery. Overall: This is a great little camera with the right mix of automatic features for the beginner, but with plenty of options to appeal to the more advanced (and particular) photographer. Put it on a tripod and it's awesome. Well worth the price premium over lesser offerings.
