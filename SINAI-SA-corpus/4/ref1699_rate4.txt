        Great Camera - Needs Minor Improvements, May 25, 2008
        ByEfrain Rivera (Highland Lakes, NJ USA)  - See all my reviews
This camera is really great. I typically hate having to take pictures on vacations with my family. I usually end up carrying the equipment and hate having to be careful not to damage it or get it wet while still trying to enjoy the my vacation to its fullest. I specifically purchase the Olympus 1030SW because of I wanted a rugged waterproof camera which would allow me to take picures of our vacation and still allow me to participate in all the action. This camera really fit the bill and I was able to take some really great action pictures while participating in the action. I actually enjoyed carrying the camera and snapping all the great pictures.I just have a couple of suggestions that could be made to improve upon the the camera. First, add a view-finder to the camera. The view screen becomes useless under bright sunlight. The addition of the view-finder would help on these occasions. The second is to, of course, improve upon the view screen when in bright sunlight. On these occassions I was able to take the picture by aiming the camera in the general direction. Most of these pictures came out fine, but a view-finder would really help. Other than this I am glad I purchase this camera and can't wait till our next outing.
