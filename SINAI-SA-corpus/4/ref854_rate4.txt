This is a great point and shoot camera.  I've used it for a week now.  I've taken pictures of at an air show with the Thunderbirds, and lots of pictures of my 1-year grandson (which is definitely a challenge). It has been great.  I wish the zoom was a bit more, but it's OK.  It took some time learning the basics and there's still a lot more I need to learn to utilize all of the features.
