I've been a fan of Canon cameras for years now...I've owned the A40, A60, SD630 and my current camera is the SD870IS and I have loved each and every one of them. This A590IS was a birthday present for my elderly father and would be his first digital camera. I didn't want to spend too much or get a camera that was too tiny or packed with features he would never use. I knew that the shape of this camera (because of AA batteries) would be easier to hold than my tiny SD Eplh's (it is) yet still provide a more than adequate point and shoot when set to auto. Another thing about this camera that I liked is the viewfinder which makes a nice transition for someone who is not used to digicams with lcd screens on the back. The image stabilization (IS) is also worth it's weight in gold when you consider that older digital cameras had to be held absolutely still to get a good picture without blurring. My dad loves this camera..he has already stopped using the viewfinder (which is barely adequate imo)and bought rechargeable AA batteries and a nice case for it. This camera makes a perfect entry level digicam but is still packed with features when you feel comfotable trying them out.Pros:Small and light without being too tinyTakes very good pics even on autoPacked with featuresThe price is rightcons:viewfinder is too small and not accurateShape makes it not as "pocketable" as the SD series
