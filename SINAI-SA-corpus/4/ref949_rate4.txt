        Very Nice, November 12, 2008
        ByDuke (Boston)  - See all my reviews
Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Blue)                                   I bought this camera from Amazon.com for $164.00.  It is a real nice little camera, mostly made of metal with a couple of plastic doors to its outputs & Battery/memory card compartment.  I also bought the PSC-1000 Blue case & a Hi capacity SD Memory card, ScanDisk 2GB Extreme lll SD Card.  I wish I had bought the PSC-55 case which I feel looks a lot nicer.I have owned this camera less then a week & so far no problems.I wish it had a rubber feel on the edges, like most cell phones have. It's real easy to stick in your pocket & not have to drag around a camera bag.The Menu is easy to use but takes practice to see what all the icons stand for.  Don't bother calling Canon's Help Desk at they are useless.  They only read from the Book you are looking at.The Battery charger is nicely made & takes 1-1/2 hr to charge.I set the camera in the Auto mode (which I am sure most people who buy in this price range use) Flash to Auto, anti shake On, face detection On and resolution at L & compression at super fine.  Those are the top settings & if you want to Email any of your pictures after downloading to your computer you can always knock down the resolution.I did not install the Canon computer Software since I download straight from the Memory Card. When turning on the camera you need to be careful that you do not interfere with the lens extending.I think this subcompact camera is the way to go unless you are a pro or think you are a pro and want something like a $1000 & up SLR.
