        Good camera - trains the photographer, December 26, 2002
        By A Customer
If you are willing to learn about photography and how to use a real camera - the 5700 coolpix is for you. I have had this camera and both love and hate it.The reasons are:1. It takes great pictures if you learn how to operate the camera. For me, it was often out of frustration that compelled me to take better photographs. 2. It made me a better photographer because I was forced to learn what Shutter priority, Aperture priority, White Balance are. 3. The EVF (electronic view finder) is horrific in the dark - You are literally shooting in the dark. 4. Battery consumption is horrendous - get the MB-E5700 battery grip!
