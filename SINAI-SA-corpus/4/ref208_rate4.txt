        Very Good Camera, February 17, 2009
        BySentinel (Ash Grove Mo. USA)  - See all my reviews
There are dozens of reviews on this site concerning this camera and all the reviews are good. That convinced me to buy the camera. The pictures are very good and the camera is as the reviews state versatile. The Easy mode is impossible to screw-up and there's a lot of fun things to learn and do. The video on this camera has gotten a bad rap. I think the video is nearly as good as my Sony Hi8 camcorder. There is some noise on low light indoor pictures, but for a 100 dollar bill I can't imagine a better camera. My only issue is battery consumption. Buy a good rechargeable battery system with 4 batteries because you'll need them. The image stabilizer really makes a difference when using the zoom. Don't buy a camera without image stabilization.Bill
