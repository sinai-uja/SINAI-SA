        Good money for little gem, February 3, 2009
        ByH. TAN (Connecticut USA)  - See all my reviews
It has all the good old Canon layout of controls plus a good lens. Not exactly pocketable but small enough to carry about. It takes good pictures and good video. Aperture priority auto exposure does not work well in low light. You will have to use Manual exposure with some trial and error to get it right.
