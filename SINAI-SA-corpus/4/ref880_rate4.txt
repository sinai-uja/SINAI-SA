        Just what I wanted in a small camera, November 2, 2008

I bought this because I wanted a small digital camera for basic everyday pictures and it has been great.  It takes good shots, is easy to take places (it fits in the cell phone pocket of my purse) and is easy to use.The battery life is awesome, I have only had to charge it once in the last three weeks, and I have taken tons of pictures.  The only drawback is the memory card that comes with it only holds 13 pictures, so I upgraded it to a 2G one that will hold hundreds.Love this camera!  Have noticed many other people with the same one, and the love it too
