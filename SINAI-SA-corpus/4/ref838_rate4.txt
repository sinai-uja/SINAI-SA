        overexposes, a bit slow, and background audio too loud, otherwise nice, May 7, 2008

There are three annoying problems that I can see so far, otherwise the camera seems nice. The first problem is that in auto, the camera tends to overexpose so that whites are badly lacking detail. The second is that the background audio in movie mode is loud, so that if you're taking a silent movie, even a very mild wind sounds like your movie was taken during a hurricane. The third is that the recovery time is a bit slow so that the time lag before you can zoom the lens or take the next picture is noticeable. There may be a way to compensate for these faults, but I haven't found them yet. On the other hand, the size is nice, build quality seems nice, pictures are generally excellent in both sharpness and color.
