I bought this camera for my wife, we already owned a canon digital SLR but needed something that we could just leave in her handbag. First of all this camera is small and very light and fits very nice in her bag, the image quality is very close to my SLR This camera is not for a advanced photographer its options are all dumbed down to basic settings such as "night shot" "snow" " fireworks" there is not a option for manual adjustment of the f stop but the camera does a awesome job if you are using the correct setting for the photo.The only down side to this camera is that the focus light is rather bright, when we take a close-up of my daughter it causes her to squint in some photos.
