I purchased this camera for my classroom to take pictures of my students and their activities.  The camera is easy to use, takes great pictures.  The delay between pictures can be a little frustrating, but I have learned to adapt to the delay.  Picture review is simple and straightforward. There are many features on this camera, which requires reading of the manual (not my strength).  However, reading the manual will let you use this camera to it's fullest potential.  If you don't read the manual, it is a game of trial and error to find the right setting.  I like the feature of AA batteries, easier to carry extras.  The location for the memory card is easily accessible as well.  Overall, great first digital camera.  Takes quality pictures and the Cannon name and reputation are obvious.
