This product is more user friendly than advertised. Pictures are veryprofessional. I love the cameral!!!! One very minor quirk, memory chipthat comes in new camera only holds 6 - 8 pictures and this is not notedin the english language "How to operate" manual. With its new 2GB card itis flawless.  Consumers Reports was conservative in their praise of thisproduct.
