        Great camera! just make sure you have spare batteries, January 4, 2009
        ByConnie M. Jan  - See all my reviews
This camera produces great pictures and has several settings to use. After turning off all the silly noises that drove me nuts i use this camera often and am always happy with the pictures i get. I'll assume it's my rechargeable AA batteries that don't last long enough but it i never get as many pictures as i want out of one battery life. It's also probably due to the fact that when you have the viewer pulled out more battery battery is being used. Since it's run on 4 AA batteries this camera is a little larger than other cameras on the market, but the bulb created by the batteries makes a nice handle.
