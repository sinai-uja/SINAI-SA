        GREAT FOR BEGINNERS, March 13, 2006

This was my first digital camera and I love it. After years of having a film SLR I was skeptical about moving up to a digital. I was afraid that the pictures just wouldn't compare. The digital SLRs are just so expensive and I wasn't sure how I would do with digital. I wanted something with the ease of point and shoot but with option to go at least semi-manual. This camera is perfect. The price can't be beat. I have taken some absolutely beautiful photos and the quality is exceptional. The 5 MP is just fine and handles an 8x10 with ease and even has the ability to be blown up larger than that w/o losing picture quality. The sport setting is awesome as long as you get focused at the correct distance before the action starts. The battery that came with the camera has lasted so much longer than I expected it to. I have had the camera for over a month and shot hundreds of pics without the battery going dead yet. Overall, it is has been a great camera to start out with. I will move up to a DSLR one of these days but for now I couldn't be happier with my Z740.
