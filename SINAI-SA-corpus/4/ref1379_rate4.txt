        unbeatable for the money, August 13, 2005
        Byno expert "poolman" (strongsville,oh)  - See all my reviews
i am by no means an expert but this camera continues to impress me. easy to use, not too big or too small and the prints from the printer dock have wonderful color and clarity. using the digital zoom can take some getting used to only because it is hard to hold the camera still enough without the use of a tripod to get a clear pic. i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a digital camera with top end performance with mid range price, printer dock is well worth the money. more than enough features to keep you busy for a long time.  i love it! i cannot believe i lived so long without it.
