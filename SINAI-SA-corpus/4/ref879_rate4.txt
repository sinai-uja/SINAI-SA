        Nice camera, but no one mentions the special Canon battery, December 25, 2008
        ByPeter Trzop (Bardstown, Kentucky)  - See all my reviews
Just got this camera on Christmas morning.  The wife is happy since it is a small and direct camera.  Amazon.com did an excellent job getting the camera and memory sticks to the house on Christmas Eve.  Kudos to the Campbellsville FC, which I am sure a friend of mine packed out for me, lol.  A few things to be aware of before buying this camera:-- Read the reviews that list out the specs on this cameras, features, etc.  They are nice to review and give you an idea what is going on.-- BUT, I have not found one that mentions the special NB-4L battery this camera uses instead of regular ones.  This is not a huge deal, but like any special battery comes issues with What If the Battery Dies?  You will be jammed up, since it is unique, and does not charge quickly like the Rayvoc 15 minutes ones.  -- BUY at least a few more battery back ups!-- Remember, this is a point and shoot, not a professional grade camera, so do not expect the world from it.  For the price and size, it does solid work, and will prove a great camera for years to come.-- Consumer Reports named this camera their Top Pick for Compacts!  But they failed to mention the battery as well.  This was one of the rare rankings from CR that they did not recommend every item in a category, so this could mean a great product.Good luck, and like any product, if it has an error, get with the companies as fast as possible for a replacement or refund.  I have always bought Fuji products for the larger cameras, but they do not make very good smaller cameras.  According to all the magazines, Canon is the standard right now, so we will see.
