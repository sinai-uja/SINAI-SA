        Just the camera I needed, February 10, 2009

After dabbling over tens of different camera models, ranging from Nikon to Canon and Olympus, I settled for the Pentax with much conviction. I was drawn towards many of the useful features that Pentax has put into the K200D including: Shake Reduction, Weatherproof Body, Robust Build Quality, use of AA batteries for power, and Backwards compatibility with almost all Pentax lenses since the 70s.One drawback was the effectiveness of Shake Reduction. While it helps for indoor, no-flash photos, it still doesn't compensate for much of the blur and motion. But then, you could still always use a good tripod to fix that.A very nice camera that helps beginning or expert photographers grow into their techniques.
