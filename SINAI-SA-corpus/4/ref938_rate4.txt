        Great updated version of old favorite, January 12, 2009

We had one of the early Canon Elph cameras and it was a great work horse but only 3 megapixels.  We needed to update and this one is even easier to use and smaller.  Only drawback is you have to keep your fingers away from the controls on the back of the camera or you'll unintentionally make changes.  Product came with a defective memory card which delayed us using it.  We called customer service. They advised us to buy a new one at Radio Shack. If it worked, return the old one for a replacement. We did, but it was a small extra expense.
