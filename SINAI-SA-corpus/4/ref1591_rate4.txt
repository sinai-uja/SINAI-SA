        Very convenient camera., August 9, 2008

The fist time I took it in salt water was nerve wracking, but it worked as advertised.  The underwater pictures are tricky to get, and you do need to use the underwater setting or the shots come out blurry.  It takes great pictures for a camera that you can treat like a B** stepchild.  Because of the fact that it's so rugged and takes good pictures, I will probably get another one in the future.  If you want to take stunning pictures though, you need to purchase a quality DSLR.Quick note: Buy an extra battery!  You can find generic replacement batteries online for about $12 bucks a piece at the time of this writing, and I strongly recommend you get at least one.Also, you dont need to purchase the expensive XD card, it comes with an adaptor that accepts the common and CHEAP MicroSD card.
