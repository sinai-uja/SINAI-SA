        Hardware good, manual could be improved, October 24, 2007

I bought this camera to replace a cheapie 2 MP camera. The Canon A630 is a great camera! Lots of features, some of which I am still trying to learn after 3 months. What decided me on this one is the LCD which can be flipped and oriented at will. For one, by rotating the screen 180 degrees I can take photos of ourselves while seeing the photo-to-be. And it is also very useful when taking photos at odd angles, for example at ground level, without having to twist myself into a pretzel. Of course, the manual has been written by an engineer: for example, it states how to do something but never explains why you would want to do it in the first place, and the benefits of doing it. Obviously somebody has assumed that all those features are well known by the user and certainly do not need expounding on. Ergo, a lot of experiments are necessary to figure things out.
