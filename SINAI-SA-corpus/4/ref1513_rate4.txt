        Nikon CoolPix 5700 - EXCELLENT Value!, May 18, 2006

I purchased the E5700 back when its cost was around $975. It was money well spent. My amateur and semi-pro photography career has spanned three decades, so I've seen some good and many bad cameras over the years. The CP5700 is one of the best, IMO.This was my first digital camera -- moving from a 35mm SLR (Canon A-1) to a pro-sumer digi. Although a bit smaller than the A-1, the CoolPix 5700 still feels pretty substantial in my hands. The feature set allows for full auto (Aperture, Shutter, Program) and full manual shooting. I also love the fact that I can carry ONE camera and take color OR B&W photos. The BEST thing about the Nikon 5700 is the screen. While it is not nearly as large as some newer models, it is the most versatile I've ever encountered. The screeen swivels in ALL directions -- making it possible to compose photos from ANY angle. In fact, I use it frequently to take overhead and on-the-ground pics. AWESOME!Add an SB flash, or a battery pack and you're ready for pro-shooting. I would advise one thing though -- *IF* you can't find the 5700 for under $525, I would suggest stepping up to the CoolPix 8700 (same camera, but 8MP) for a little more $$$.BTW, one problem often seen on the 5700 is the scrambled screen. Nikon will repair and clean the camera FREE of charge if that is the problem. I had mine done recently -- 8 days total turnaround. Lastly, the lens error most people experience is their own fault. They put the camera in a camera bag that's too small or turn it on in a confined space -- thus messing up the lens motor. In almost four yrs of owning the 5700, I have had ONE lens error message -- and it was 100% MY fault.
