This camera is my second digital camera. My first one was Canon A530.I see two drawbacks with this camera. Not good for night scenes and it requires 4 batteries. The battery lid handling looks slightly clumsy. While opening or closing, i have a strange feeling that it would brake. However you wont be using that part of the camera often. Apart from all that, the quality is simply superb. There are 5 levels of resolution. Average resolution is more than enough. So imagine how good the max resolution would be.This camera is a good option for any non professional.
