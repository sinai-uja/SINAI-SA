        Excellent outdoor camera, December 19, 2008
        ByArchman (Lincoln, CA  USA)  - See all my reviews
Purchased the camera to take pictures on our Hawaii cruise.  The following reflects our requirements:1.  Small and portable with good grip (not too skinny)2.  Good zoom (3x or higher)3.  LCD and viewfinder4.  AA batteries5.  Inexpensive6.  Image stabilization7.  Good reviews from amazonAfter considering other point and shoot cameras, my wife and I settled for the 590IS.  It met all of our requirements and the pictures came out amazing.  Almost all of the outside pictures had exceptional details.  It made cropping and reducing picture size for sending out to friends and families very easy.  One buddy (photographer) noted how well the Cannon took pictures inside the house....not too noisy (within 5 feet, further and you will need an external flash which is expensive).  Another photographer buddy actually recommended this camera independently of my research.  We are glad that we received this camera prior to the trip.  We are truly delightful with the results.  One note for those taking a lot of inside pictures.  You will need an external flash unit (High-Power Flash HF-DC1 - about $100) to get good pictures beyond 5-7 feet.  I will start trying the manual controls for some creative picture taking.
