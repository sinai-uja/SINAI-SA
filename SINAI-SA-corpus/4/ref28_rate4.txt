        ByA. Sharp (Sweeny, Texas)  - See all my reviews
I have had this camera for a little while now.Pros: Easy to navigate through menu  functions.Many different functions for different senarios.Compact size. Is alot smaller than previous models.Price was excellent.Cons: Takes gritty zoom pictures. Other than this I really have enjoyed this camera.
