I bought this item as a gift idea for my girlfriend who is a real shutterbug. I'm not very versed in the whole digital camera craze, but after reading the other reviews of this product I decided this was the way to go. The camera has proved to be easy to use and takes great photos. A larger memory card purchase has ensured this will be a gift that keeps on giving for years to come.
