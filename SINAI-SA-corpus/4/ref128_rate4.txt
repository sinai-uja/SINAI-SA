        Good buy for the price, but there are better cameras out there, December 17, 2008
        ByK. Andrews  - See all my reviews
I've owned four 7MP+ cameras, and this one comes in last for picture quality. Considering this was half of the price of any of the others, I'm not complaining too much. My primary reason for purchasing this inexpensive camera is so that my husband and daughter will stop borrowing mine, and that mission has now been accomplished. What I have found with this camera is that when using the preset modes, every picture I've taken has come out darker than expected. I've had to go in and adjust the brightness more than with any other camera I've ever owned. I tend to do heavy photo editing, so that was not a big deal for me considering I normally crop, adjust tones and saturation, add text, add frames, and often convert to black and white or sepia. I have not experimented yet with manual modes, and probably won't due to the fact that my husband and daughter will be the primary users. This camera comes with no internal memory at all, which I found to be a downside. A 32 MB SD card was included which holds a couple dozen photos, so you'll want to order a higher capacity one with this camera. I bought the Transcend 4 GB SDHC SD Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS4GSDHC6E [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] and it can hold over 1000 photos taken at full resolution. The battery life is excellent on this camera. I've already taken 150+ photos with the children and the batteries have not yet run out. What most impresses me with this camera is one of the few point and shoot digital cameras that can accept a wide angle or telephoto lens. I plan to order the wide angle lens and put it into my daughters stocking. (Just search Amazon for a590is lens and several options will show up.)
