        great camera except it is bigness, October 13, 2007
        ByEGEMEN OMER YILMAZ (Italy)  - See all my reviews
it is a great camera for taking high quality photos with excellent 2 and a half inch screenç Also it is wonderful that it has got a turning screen which allows you to take photos from every angle including your own photo easily (Especially when you are travelling alone). However it is a little big and also needs 4 Batteries which makes it bigger and heavier.
