This is a great little point and shoot. It's small enough to easily fit in a pocket and takes fine pictures. My one gripe is its default to crank up the ISO automatically in low light. Unless you switch to manual mode and specify your desired ISO, the camera will switch to 800 ISO and you'll get a very grainy image (assuming you've turned off the flash). That complaint aside, the camera takes outstanding pictures in daylight, captures good videos, has very good battery life and has places the controls where they're easy and intuitive to access.
