This camera was delivered as promised.  It is my second as I dropped the otherone with the lens open and I am trying to get it repaired. I use it so often I ordered another one. The price is right for the item and I use it often.  The photos are very clear and it is an easy to use camera.  I love it.  It is a bit larger than some digitals but not a problem for me.Kodak EasyShare V1003 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Slate Gray)
