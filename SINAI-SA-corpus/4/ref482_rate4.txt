        Best Camera for the Price Let Me Tell You Why!!!!, September 8, 2007
        ByGary Bruner  - See all my reviews
This is a great camera because of the quality, it's a Canon, takes clear pictures, and it's easy to use. I bought the case so I just slip it on my belt and have a 2.0MP card so I can take like 900 photos or videos. The size and it has no stabilizer are it's pit falls. You can't put the camera in your pocket or purse and if you have a problem shaking, the photo may come out fuzzy, I haven't experienced it yet. It's digital so you can always review the photos when taken. I found the night photos did not come out very clear, I experienced that with my two other digital cameras also.I went to Hawaii with it, best move I ever made- B++++ overall, A+++ Quality and Price.
