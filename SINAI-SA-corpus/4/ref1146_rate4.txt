Several people in my family have this digital camera, and they have worked for many years. We've taken this camera to the beach, camping, on road trips, to relative's houses; you name it. It has many fine points about it. If you are taking pictures at night, you can flip the stitch on the camera to 'night'; ect. This camera seems durable enough and has a video screen built into it so you can film as well.. (although it only works for a few minutes). Though this camera has several good points, there are bad things about it too, that i should mention. There isn't alot of storage space on it, which means you have to transfer the pictures onto a computer or lap top, which is hard to do if you are on the road or camping or anything like that. Also, the battery runs out easily, and if it is on when you are using it, the front of the camera will stay open, and there is no way to close it until you get another battery. The camera is really nice, and overall, i beleive it deserves four stars. One of our camera's came with a black & red camera case.
