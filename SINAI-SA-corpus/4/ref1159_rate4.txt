        It works for me!, December 8, 2004

This camera is great for my needs. I needed a camera which makes good 8 X 10's and this one does. I wanted to take some sound movies and this one takes 20 FPS videos. I tried the Kodak 5 mp camera, but it's movies would only work at 15 FPS, and it was a big noticable difference, so I took it back. Yes, it does have a tendency to overexpose, but it's no big deal for me to tweak the exposure. For the price, under 200, it's a real deal. The software is good too, and you don't need Kodak's overpriced dock..just the USB and their Easy Share CD.
