        A nice camera but .., October 3, 2008

First impression of the camera was very good (speed, sharpness, color rendition), but after short usage period the battery warning light came on.  I started using rechargeable batteries, which I had from my old Cannon 610.  This condition persisted, so I thought possibly new rechargeable batteries were in order.  I bought the highest rated rechargeable NI-MH batteries available.  They are 2700 MAH.  But, after taking 15 pictures and downloading to a PC, the battery light came on and shortly thereafter the camera shut down.  I considered this to be intolerable and sent the camera back. Did I just get a lemon?  In my old Cannon 610, a battery charge lasted forever.
