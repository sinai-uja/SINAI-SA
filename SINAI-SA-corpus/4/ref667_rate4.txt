        Great Camera ! Good for videos too, October 13, 2007

I've been owning this camera for the past 6 months. It is so easy to handle. I am not an expert photographer - the "auto" mode works well for me. This camera can be used to take good videos too. The quality of the videos taken are comparable to the ones taken by Sony DCR-HC48 camcorder. Best suited for indoor day time videos. The only drawback is the need for 4 AA batteries which makes the camera too heavy to carry. If you are used to compact models from Canon, you would find it a bit difficult to adjust to this. However, you can compromise for the nice LCD display, 8 Mega pixels photos and the quality videos. I am a loyal Canon customer and the A630 hasn't disappointed me.
