        Bytiggerpounce (Chicago, IL)  - See all my reviews
With all of the glowing reviews for this camera, I expected more from it.  It is a great looking camera, and the menu's are easily accessible.  What surprised me was how bad the picture looks in the view finder.  In indoor conditions, the viewfinder shows a fuzzy, grainy picture.  I thought the camera must be defective and got a second one, but it is the same.  The actual pictures look clear, but I am very annoyed with the viewfinder.  I haven't used the camera for that long, but it seems that I have to do a lot of red-eye editing later (even with the red eye reduction turned on).   My last camera, the Canon S30, did a much better job in eliminating red-eye from all but the lightest eyed people.  There is a continuous shooting mode, which allows you to set a 1 or 2 second delay before the camera takes another picture.  I found that even with the shortest delay (1 second) that the camera took too long to take another shot (again, indoor conditions with flash).  It's fine for a compact and cute camera, but I really expected more.
