Haven't used the camera enough to form an opinion.  Having one small problem,,,, every time I turn on the camera, the flash pops up.  Wrote to Kodak and they suggested that I send it in for repair.  I didn't think it was that big a deal, so will hold off for now.  I've got plenty of warrenty time left to deal with it if that becomes necessary.
