        excellent camera for the value, January 9, 2009

I consider myself a little bit of a photography buff, though I prefer my 35mm Pentax to anything digital. So with this Canon I was pleasantly surprised at all of the features. It ranges from a simple, user-friendly choice with automatic settings and multiple atmosphere settings, to a more complex, manual camera with a whole depth of features that make it fun to capture exactly what you want. Since I enjoy the manual aspect of 35mm, I really love the fact that I can change ISO, shutter speed, F stop, focus and everything else to really achieve the results I'm looking for. Its the first digital camera I've owned that actually operates like a camera and not a computer. Nice big screen, sturdy body, easy operating buttons  functions. I love it.The ONLY thing I don't like about it is how fast it goes through batteries. You should really get some rechargeable ones to go with this because I can go through 2AAs in one day easily with this thing.
