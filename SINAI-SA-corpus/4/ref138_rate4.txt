        Great camera, November 21, 2008

I first purchased a blue Kodak EasyShare M863 8.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Red) and hated it.  The pics taken outside were horrible.  I returned it and bought this.  It takes nice pics, both inside and out.  Easy to use.  Battery life has been fine as well.The only problem I found so far has been that the automatic setting does not take decent pics of children who are active.  So, I have to put it on the children setting.  Which is not a big deal to me.  If you are looking to keep it on one setting all the time and not worry about it, then I suggest looking for another make/model.
