I would like to say I have been impressed with the qulity of the prints from the CP760 that came with this camera. The downfall is the propriotary paper that is required.I was going to purchase another combo camera-printer from Amazon but the price went up $100.00 since I purchased mine. All in all this was a great deal for the price I paid for both camera and printer. ($179.00 with free shipping)
