        Lots of features in a small package, July 6, 2008
        ByD. Pitman  - See all my reviews
I did extensive research prior to selecting the PowerShot SD1100IS.  My other  choices were the new Nikon Coolpix and the Canon 850.  My prior camera was a Pentax Optio S.  While I own a Nikon SD80 it is large and less likely to be used than the smaller Canon.  I wanted a viewfinder and optical image stabilization with face recognition.  The new Canon has both.  My complaints center around the grainy image on the display prior to taking a picture and the inability to quickly deactivate the flash for taking photos of a distant subject (like a graduation).  Otherwise, the Canon packs a lot of features into a small package at a very reasonable price.
