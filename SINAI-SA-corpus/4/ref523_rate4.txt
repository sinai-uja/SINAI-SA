        Superior Buy When On Sale!, October 26, 2007
        ByE Deets "Reviews by Deets" (Atlanta, GA)  - See all my reviews
Bought this camera after seeing a good review and I have not been disappointed.The camera takes some good pix even when on automatic settings.  I've found the swivel screen to be a huge plus and I use it all the time.  I'm pretty tech savy, but think most folks can figure out the advanced features on this camera.And to top it off, the batteries last ten times longer in this camera than my old Fuji.  Its not the smallest camera out there, but if you don't need to slip it in your pocket, this one's a winner.
