I dont care what anyone says, kodak cameras have THE best color than any other brand and this camera proves it. The pictures are very detailed, even though it only has a 3x zoom, the image can be further zoomed upon on photoshop and still is clear. 2 things I dont like about it is the zoom sound when video recording and how the buttons are spread out, but over all a good camera. Finicky people need to get a grip.
