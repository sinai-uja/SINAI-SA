        Great Pictures, December 6, 2006
        ByT. Wright (San Antonio, TX)  - See all my reviews
I had been looking for a new digital camera for over a year.  I finally made this my pick.  At first I wasn't happy with the menus and settings.  But after testing it for a few weeks, I'm very pleased with it.The pictures are outstanding!!  If you have never used a Canon digital(I hadn't) the menu settings and multiple picture settings can be overwhelming.  Just set it to "auto" the pics come out great. Then you can slowly learn the various setting(if you want to). I'm a geek so I tested them all.-It starts up within 2 seconds and the time between shots is just over 1 second(really).-The flippable LCD screen is great, but, the quality of the image on the LCD is only fair.  If this is important to you, this camera is not for you.  It really doesn't matter to me, I prefer the optical view finder for 99% of my shots.  -There is NO information displayed in the optical view finder.-Very comfortable in the hand.-There is no battery meter (just tells you need to replace).-A little larger and heavier than a "pocket" camera.-It takes four AA batteries - which is great, can get them anywhere - no waiting for recharge.-For a still camera it takes great videos.I would recommend this camera.  It's not perfect - but after much research, it was a good choice for the price range.Also, I bought a 1GB memory card - so I don't have to work about running out of space.
