        New  Pentax  K10d buyer, January 9, 2007
        ByDuane Beggs (Bristol, Virginia)  - See all my reviews
The Pentax K10d is not a simple camera.  It has numerous features that would be important to a serious photographer.  It may not be the best choice as the  first move up from a point and shoot camera.  However, it appears to be the state-of-the-art for a 10 megapixel DSLR for those people desiring such a camera.  I was looking to move up from a two year old K-M A200 which I think is excellent in good light conditions.  I paid twice as much for the Pentax as I did for the A200 and the improvement in images does not justify the money.  However, my quality curve has flattened a lot, which is to say I will need to work harder to improve my images significantly and I think the K10d can help me do that.  I understand that the next issue of Popular Photography will have a comparison of the K10d's rivals and would recommend anyone looking to buy such a camera to review the article carefully.  Except for the K10d's anti-shake, probably the Nikon D-80 would be hard to beat, on a tripod.  Do not expect a quantum leap in image quality from the serious cameras the level below the 10 megapixel DSLR's.The build quality appears to equal my friend's Nikon D-70, but the kit lens is not impressive.  I bought the extra handle/battery holder.  When   attached with the Pentax flash, it is an impressive looking rig.  Probably buying a new DSLR is like buying a new car, one can read all the specs andopinions, but nothing beats a test drive, because they are all pretty good.
