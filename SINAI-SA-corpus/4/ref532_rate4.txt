I'm really happy with this camera so far.  It has all of the functions that I wanted in a camera and many that I haven't discovered yet.  It takes wonderful pictures and is very intuitive.  The only downfall is the recovery time between photos isn't quite as quick as I would like, but it's not terrible.
