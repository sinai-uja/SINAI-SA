        wonderful camera, July 7, 2005

I decided on this camera after receiving photos from a friend that had a Kodak.  The images were amazingly sharp and the prints I made looked professional.  I hate reading owners manuals, but this camera is extremely user friendly.  My one complaint is that the batteries that come with the camera are not rechargable.  The camera is a little bulky (less than the previous model), but I bought it for the quality of photos, not to fit into my back pocket.  It is very easy to download the photos to my computer using the USB port, however I have a little trouble transferring them to the other photo program I prefer to use, but this is most likely my fault due to lack of knowledge of the programs.  If you are looking for a camera to preserve memories, I highly recommend the Z740.
