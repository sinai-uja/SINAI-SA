        What I expected, January 17, 2009
        ByB. Foutz  - See all my reviews
This is a great little camera. It's very light. It has a lot of features for the price. Battery life is amazing. The camera body is beautiful, but some of the external parts are plastic--such as the function slider--and seem too flimsy to stand up to frequent use. I read many reviews on the camera. It is top rated for its class and price, and it has proven to be what I expected (small, light, inexpensive, and easy to use). I am happy with my purchase.
