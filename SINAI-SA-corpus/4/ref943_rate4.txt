        Great camera - UNLESS you are unlucky, July 9, 2008
        ByTracey Switek  - See all my reviews
This camera is a fantastic buy. Small, convenient, reasonable settings. It's about everything you could want in a point-and-shoot digital camera that can fit in your pocket.HOWEVER, a certain percentage of these cameras experence a fatal "lens error" which basically means unless you send it back for repair you will never be able to use it again. Canon does not like to admit that this is a common error on their cameras, has not fixed the design flaw, and WILL NOT REPAIR it for free if you are out of warranty. I am fortunate that this happened to me while still in warranty (acutally less than two months after purchase) and have sent it back to Canon for repair. It remains to be seen whether they will attempt to charge or blame me for the malfunction. I am very upset about this because I bought this camera specifically so I would be able to take pictures of our trip for our 2nd wedding anniversary, and now I cannot because it will still be in the shop.To summarize: fantastic camera when it works, totally useless if you're unlucky and get a defective one. Just hope if you do, it shows the defect before your warranty expires or you're out $100-200.
