I've had my Coolpix 5700 for a couple of months. It's a great camera except for its autofocus function when the subject is not well illuminated. The autofocus circuit is based on contrast detection through the lens by analyzing the real picture (when on focus, the picture displays maximim contrast) as opposed to most other cameras which bounce off the subject an infrared beam and mesure the signal delay to determine the distance. The contrast detection technique is definitely more accurate as the camera precisely knows which part of the picture it is analyzing. The infrared beam bouncing is not equally as accurate, and it requires that the lens has a great depth of field so that the picture is compensated for slight inaccuracies in focusing. All in all, it's a great camera, definitely in a league in itself. Its lens is exceptionally good quality. I also bought the wide angle lens for it. The picture quality is superb even with the wide angle adapter.The quality of the product is definitely consistent with what you would expect from Nikon, and I am hoping that they will offer soon a corrective firmware for the autofocus issue.
