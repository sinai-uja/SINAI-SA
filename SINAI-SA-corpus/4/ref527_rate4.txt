        Great pix, terrible shutter lag, September 25, 2007
        ByGary J. Landman (NEW PALTZ, NY United States)  - See all my reviews
A very good camera, super clear pictures, very handy view screen that swivels all around, but a terribly slow lag time between pushing the shutter button and the camera actually taking the picture.
