        Works well but looks cheap, February 7, 2009

I have no problem with the quality of the camera. It works well and takes very good photos, so I can't fault it on performance, especially for the price. But it looks really cheap, and whenever I use it I can't help feeling like I bought it at the 99-cents store and it's going to fall apart in my hands. It doesn't fall apart, fortunately, but if I had seen the real thing before I bought it, rather than just an image on the web, I would have passed it by. I'd rather have a camera that both works well and looks and feels solid.
