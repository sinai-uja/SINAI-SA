It is worth the money.  It's affordable.  It's stylish, compact, thin, lightweight and a good point and shoot digital camera.  It may not be the best digital camera for a professional or an advance user, but it's a good digital camera for regular people who don't know much about photography.  Because of its size, you can bring it anywhere and put in your pocket.  It's convenient.  It also comes with video recorder with sound.  The features are easy to understand and use.  It comes with digital image stabilizer.  This camera is good to be used in dark places, because the picture will look brighter.  The only cons is if the pictures were taken in bright area, the pictures look a little bit dark.  Everything else is good and worth the money.
