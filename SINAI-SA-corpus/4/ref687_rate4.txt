        Canon A630, June 14, 2007
        ByJed Schaiman (New Jersey)  - See all my reviews
I like the camera and did a lot of research before buying it.  I didn't realize how handy and convenient  and valuable the pull out rotating screen is. You quickly learn to take advantage of high and low shots. Amazon had the best price especialy if you take into account free shipping and sales tax ;-).I am just a little disappointed in ths storage speed but I can live with it.The camera arrived before the promised data.
