        Nice Canon quality, with a few flaws, October 15, 2008

Just got this camera as a supplement for my other Canon, which is too big to just throw in my pocket like this can be. I am very happy with the size, weight, and images so far.I would say it is the same size and weight as a deck of cards, I might try a card case as my camera case! The materials of this camera are very nice, with only a few problems for me right now. The entire case is made of metal, except the battery cover and cable port cover. I think the battery cover should have been made of metal also for durability, and it is a bit weak in holding it shut; seems like it will be easy to open it accidentally, but the battery is held inside with a notch, so its just annoying for now. And on the front, it would have been nice if the silver rings that make up the lens assembly were a matte finish instead of glossy to match the rest of the camera. Flash works good, 2-3 sec btwn shots, and 1 sec startup time, so fast!Otherwise, I look forward to using this little toy for some great snapshots. Will update in the future.
