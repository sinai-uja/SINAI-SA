        Too much noise, May 19, 2007

The cam is not so bad for usual circumstances using flash light, but for me as an designer there is too much noise. Even when I set ISO to 80 with still images and long exposure time, there is noise that overlays too much of the resolution, using a camera that has a 4 megapixel resolution if it makes very clean noiseless images the result is as good or better then that of the powershot 630 / 8 MPixel, but with that much of noise all the megapixels are useless. Generally it needs a lot of light to make it a minimum of noise but its still there.
