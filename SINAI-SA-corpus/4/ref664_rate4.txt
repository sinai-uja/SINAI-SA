        GREAT camera with a few kinks, December 6, 2007
        ByZiti man (Rochester, NY)  - See all my reviews
If you're looking to purchase a camera, I would seriously consider adding this one to your research list. Below are the major Pros and Cons. As you will see, the pros are much more numerous than the cons, but the it really depends on what's important to you.PROS:-Great picture quality. Those 8 MP really pay off.-Wide range of options. Choose from differnt types of lighting available, sharpness of the pictures, ISO ranges, and app settings.-Ease of use. I personally monkey around with it before my pictures to get the best quality, but your waitress could grab it and take the picture without having to get a lecture on usage.-Fairly accurate rendition of the picture on the LCD screen-Big LCD screen-Adjustable screen. This seems strange to need it, but it comes in handy ALL THE TIME. I'm a young guy, so my friends and I are always taking pictures of ourselves when we're out, so the screen can turn towards the front of the camera to accomidate. Also, you can angle the screen so that you can take the pictures in strange positions and still get good view.-The digital zoom is 4x. This is huge. The most I've seem besides this was 3.5x. It also has a 16x optical zoom, which is nice, but shouldn't be confused with digital.CONS:-For some reason, there is no image stability on this model. Earlier and later models have them, but not this one. If you don't know how to play with the ISO settings, then this could be an issue.-Low-light pictures can be another issue. Again, there are ways to monkey areound with it, but if you don't want that extra work, that is an issue to consider.-Macro settings are nice, but on a camera of this caliber, it really should also have a super macroHope this was helpful!
