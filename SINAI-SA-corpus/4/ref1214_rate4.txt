I think this is one of the best Kodak has ever produced. It is stylish and sleek. It looks more like a cell phone than a camera and thats the attraction. It includes the AC charger unlike the 12MP I just bought which u have to charge with your Pc or laptop if u dont buy the AC charger saperately. It doesn't really blur like the 12MP too. The 12MP is just better only by the shutter speed. I would recommend this better than the 12MP
