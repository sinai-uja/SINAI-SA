This is my third digital camera and out of all the ones I have owned, it is the most intuitive and easiest to figure out. I only thumbed through the manual and was taking pics in no time. It's great for basic point-and-shoot projects. The brown color is unique. It stands out among the silvers and blacks. I was worried that it would look cheap -- but if anything, it looks more expensive than it is. Very happy with the price, although I don't understand why the brown color is 20-some-odd dollars more than the pinks and blues. Great value for the low price.
