        Great little camera at a great price, January 24, 2009

This little Canon has IS, 4X telephoto, 8MP, and uses 2 AA batteries. The controls are simple and easy to use. It takes great photos.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that it is slower between shots than I would like. But for the price I think it cannot be beat.
