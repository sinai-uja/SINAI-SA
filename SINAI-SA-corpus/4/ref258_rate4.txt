        a good camera, January 28, 2009
        ByL. Grady (Chattanooga, TN)  - See all my reviews
A great camera for a great price. I love the clear pictures it takes, good color, and the IS feature really gives a sharp image when you don't expect it! Also, the battery life seems to be fine...I am still using the two AA batteries that came with the camera - i was worried by other reviews that I would have to be constantly changing/charging them. The cons of the camera are that it is plastic, and therefore feels a little more fragile and cheaper than the previous Canon I owned. The moving parts/buttons seem a bit flimsy. Also, as noted in other reviews, the lens going in and out is noisy. But overall, I feel I have a great camera for the price I paid!
