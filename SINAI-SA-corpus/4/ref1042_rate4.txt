This product is OK.  It's not what i expected, it does take good quality pics and will serve the purpose we are wanting it for, but i was a little dissapointed for the price i paid.  Maybe i just haven't figured out all the 'gadgets' on it yet. But when i call customer service for help, they are NO help AT ALL and sound just as clueless as me!
