        A great little camera, January 12, 2009

I bought this camera for my parents, who desperately needed an upgrade.I have spent some time with the camera in order to teach them how to use it and so far it seems to be a an excellent little camera.  Certainly its no DSLR but for the money it has every feature you could want for a point and shoot and takes excellent shots.  They had a blast learning about the macro function and how easy it is to use.  I am tempted to buy another one for myself to use until I can afford the 50 D.
