This camera is more then I bargained for, Great 4x optical zoom, various picture settings.  Swivel screen lets you take pictures like your operating a video camera. Video also comes out very clear and sound is great.  I would give it 5 stars execpt for 2 things... 1. It comes with a measly 16mb sd card, which can hold about 7-12 pictures or about 7 sec of video. So I would suggest a 1 or 2g card.  2. I would suggest buying good quality 2500NiHm recargeable batteries, It will be cheaper in the long run.  Overall, execelent!
