        Not that bad!!!, May 8, 2008

Too many bad comments about this product. I have to be fair. The quality of the pictures can be as good as that of my Canon SD630 (the auto-focus function is even smarter because it knows where to focus), and much better than my older Sony Cybershot DSC-T5. It also amazes me with the very smart panorama function, allowing me to take 3 different pictures then merge them together to make a wide panorama.That said, it can be the slowest camera I ever had in terms of operation. However, I don't mind that because I don't use it for taking pictures of children. For my personal need, I would give it 4 stars.
