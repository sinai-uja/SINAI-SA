OK, I'll review this purchase. To begin with I will say that 4 stars is as high as I rate anything...it's just a thing. Earning five stars will only become a factor after much use and practical evaluation.I am pleased with my purchase. Great value. And as with most modern hard- and software, it offers more than I need. So if it works for many years (unlike my first digital camera), I'll be very pleased.That's all for now.
