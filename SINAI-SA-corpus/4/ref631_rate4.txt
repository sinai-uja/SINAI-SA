I bought my Canon power Shot A630 by may 27th, it arrives like was scheduled, Well the only complaint that i have is when I use the zoom after the 4X optical zoom, and beging the digital zoom it distorts the image, it seems that i can't close up the image perfectly.after that there is no other complaint.
