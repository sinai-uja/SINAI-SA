        Canon Powershot A630 - great bargin, January 9, 2007
        ByIsla girl (Johnstown, NY United States)  - See all my reviews
For the price, this is a great camera.  This is my second digital camera.  I am used to my 35mm Canon Rebel X, which I love.  It is much easier to take with you although for some things there is no replacing the 35mm.  I find this model easier to handle than the more compact models of digital camera.  It's pretty simple to operate.  It takes very good quality pictures that have good resolution for enlarging.  The video feature is best used without too much of a zoom unless it is a stationary or very slow moving object.  Zooming in on flying birds was disappointing.  But having the option to take short snip-its of video is a great feature to have.  I haven't used the "compact" video feature very much.  The "standard" video feature eats up you SD card pretty fast so don't use anything smaller than a 1GB SD card or you might miss something important by having to stop and change cards.  All in all, I am very happy with this camera.  (It also has an under water case available - another great feature)
