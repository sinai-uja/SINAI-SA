        Great camera but lacks..., September 6, 2008

We took this camera to Puerto Vallarta last August.  It did really well with pictures taken on the outside.  The underwater pictures were great too.  The only problem I have with this camera is the fact that when in movie recording mode, you can't zoom.This is the second Olympus camera I've owned and love the ease of use.  But aside from this minor issue, I would say this is as good a product as my older Olympus.
