May be I haven't used enough to write review since I bought this camera a month ago. But I used Canon Rebel (big one) with similar function for 5 years. I found this cheaper but newer one is better than old one which is 8 times more expensive back then.Image stabilizer function is especially working great. I took picture indoor lit not enough. But it came out quite sharp. If you don't mind a little bigger size, I recommend this camera. No need to spend more money.
