        Fantastic, Tough Camera, June 27, 2008
        ByM. Henry (Kansas City, MO)  - See all my reviews
This is a GREAT camera.  Takes nice, clear, well detailed pictures that show well on a computer and make lovely prints.  Functions are easy to understand and use.  Have taken it to the pool and it is waterproof as claimed and the underwater pictures it took were just fabulous.  Only complaint is that the power button and the shoot button are awfully close together which makes it easy to accidently turn the camera off instead of shoot a picture.  Also, the lens is in kind of an aquward place if you have larger hands, so you have to watch where you are holding the camera or your fingers will find their way into the picture.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy it again!
