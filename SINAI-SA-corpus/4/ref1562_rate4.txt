        Good fix for the bits I didnt like in the last generation of SW Cameras, March 7, 2008
        ByPetey (Boston, MA)  - See all my reviews
I bought the green Olympus Stylus 1030SW after losing a 770SW that I had for 6 months. Yes, its crush proof, ice proof, heat proof, drop proof and water proof but not loss proof!It seems Olympus have fixed all the bits I did not like about the previous model. The fidgety controls and menu system are now much easier to use. The spec has been significantly upgraded with the widescreen lense (not so wide that you notice a huge different but nice all the same), 3.6x zoom and much better video capabilities as well as the ability to take 10MP shots. There is a huge array of scene modes for every possible need with a helpful multi multi-devided screen view for trying out different ISO settings.From 3 days of playing with it I really like what I see, its very rugged although i would have liked a viewfinder for those moments in the wilderness where the battery is dying or sun is shining on the LCD. The green model is much nicer in reality then it looks online (British Racing Green is the color-name in the UK FYI). It comes with a helpful MASD connector so if you have a microSD card lying about, it will fit the xD style adaptor and fit in the camera. So far it hasnt slowed the camera down at all. I cant wait to get it out kayaking or skiing some day to really put it to the test.
