This has all the basic features and its working perfectly well. I have used it and the picture quality is very good. Considering the cost, its an excellent product.Only problem, the same that I have read in the reviews while buying the product, is that it takes some times for the flash to load after taking a picture, say about 4 seconds. If you dont think this is a problem for you, this camera is the best.
