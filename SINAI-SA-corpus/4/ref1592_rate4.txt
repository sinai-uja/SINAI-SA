I'm very happy with this product overall.  I think it has some great features and takes nice pictures.  I haven't used it underwater yet but will be in a couple of weeks.  My only complaint is the zoom is not that impressive.  My previous point and shoot camera's have had a much better zoom.  But I'm still happy with the product.
