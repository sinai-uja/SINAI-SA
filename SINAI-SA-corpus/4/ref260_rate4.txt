        Mostly I love the PowerShot A590IS, January 28, 2009
        ByMary Austin (San Antonio TX)  - See all my reviews
The only thing I don't like about this camera is the user's manual which is too small with tiny print and tiny Black  White illustrations. The learning curve here is challenging with this hindrance. I want to use features I am used to in non-digital cameras, i.e. control over aperature settings and shutter speed, easy zooming, etc but to do so in a digital there is a lot to learn and this camera's documentation does not make it easy.I like the feel of the camera in my hand. Because I am far-sighted, I needed the viewfinder in addition to the digital viewer so I am happy to have that. The images I have shot have been steady and nicely exposed even on the Auto setting.I am still learning but so far I am happy with the camera.
