My brother bought the A610 and was so pleased with it, I decided to buy the A630, which was a better value than what he paid for his almost a year ago.  So far, I very happy with its performance but had to take away one star for the weight.  Perhap a half star would be more appropriate, but that wasn't possible.  I doubt I ever use all the bells and whistles this camera features, but the quality of photos and its use-friendly functions are impressive enough to make this a super deal.
