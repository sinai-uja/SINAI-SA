        Upgrade from another Canon, November 7, 2008
        ByB. Williams  - See all my reviews
We got this camera to replace an older Canon PowerShot.  I was so pleased with the old one, that I pretty much only considered another Canon PowerShot.  With this camera, all the photos look blurry in the LCD but they don't look that blurry once you get them onto the computer.  This camera seems to have a lot of trouble in anything less than bright sunlight.
