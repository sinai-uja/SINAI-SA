Got the PS SD1100IS to replace an older Canon digital. This is a big improvement since the other was about 3 years old, and tho it took great shots it was bulky and sometimes had a maddening delay when trying to shoot portraits. This new camera is much more compact, takes great pictures that download faster and is a joy to use. DIS was important to me and I am still testing this; but so far it seems to be an improvement over the older stabilization technology. I got about 200 shots before needing to recharge, and charging time is quick. It will still delay a little when shooting under low light conditions, but that is the nature of digital photography. And it has less flexible capabilities for manually making your own settings; but overall I am very pleased to have this sophisticated little camera that can go anywhere. It is smaller so you have to pay attention where you leave it! You will need to get a decent bag for it that straps to your belt or goes over your neck. Also will need a larger memory card. The ordering process went very smoothly and there were no surprises.
