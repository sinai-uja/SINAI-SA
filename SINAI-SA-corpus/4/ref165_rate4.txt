I've only had this camera for a month, but I find myself using it more than I did my last one.  I love the convenience of being able to use regular AA batteries. Another reviewer said it uses up the batteries fast and he was right!  Luckily, I was expecting it and carried extras around while on vacation.  I am not the best person with a camera and still take blurry shots, but I do manage to take some good pictures.  Overall, I am very happy with it.
