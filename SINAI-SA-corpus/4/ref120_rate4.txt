        Probably can't be beat in this price range!, December 21, 2008

I was looking to buy a less expensive, last year's model point and shoot, because our last camera took a beating, was dropped and died. Got more than I expected with this camera. Very nice features, good pictures. One feature that I love - When you turn the camera to get a tall shot, the camera knows and formats and saves the picture as a "portrait" photo as opposed to "landscape". Very cool.
