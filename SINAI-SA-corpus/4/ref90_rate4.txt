Seems to be a very good value for the price.  Does produce a lot of noise in low light shooting, but gives a wide range of options for adjusting shutter speed and aperture, so you can experiment a bit and get an image that pleases you.  Like that it takes regular batteries and seems to have good life for the alkalines that came with it.  Not overly small so it's easy to handle, and the controls are pretty straightforward.  Overall, B+, and that's good for the price of this camera.
