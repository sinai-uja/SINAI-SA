        Good camera, frustrating sometimes, September 23, 2007
        ByGabriel's Buddy (Carrboro, NC USA)  - See all my reviews
I'll let you read the specs for what this camera has and just use this space to explain the biggest thing I noticed. It is a very good camera with many good features. The points below are mostly negative, but none of them are big enough to make me want a different camera.1) Like all digital cameras, the shutter delay is frustrating. My laughing baby will turn his head and look away from the time I press the shutter and the time the picture is actually taken.2) It is hard to get good auto-focused pictures indoors. I assume it has to do with lower light inside, but it is frustrating to see a good picture on the display only to see it fuzzy when you download it.3) Sometimes it won't take pictures. I don't know if it is waiting for the flash to charge or what, but I can point at what I think is a well lit shot, push the shutter, and nothing happens. 4) Frustrating that the display is more light sensitive than the camera. I wanted a picture of my baby sleeping. I could see him just great in the display (it was dark, but that is what it looks like in real life and what I wanted to capture), but the picture comes out black. You can get the picture if you play around with one of the manual modes, but it is always a guess what you will get. It would be nicer if the display was more WYSIWYG.5) Battery life is great!6) You can get great images out of this camera and 8 MP is great when you want to crop.7) I love the ability to take multiple pictures on a timer.8) The video comes out very well.9) A speck of dust appeared on the inside of the lens. I am not sure how it got there or how to get it out, but it doesn't seem to affect the pictures. Annoying, none the less.10) The software is useless unless you want to stitch pictures together.
