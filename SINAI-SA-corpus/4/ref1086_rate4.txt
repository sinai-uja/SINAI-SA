        A superb take-along camera with all sorts of bells and whistles, September 24, 2008

I already own a Canon XT, which I love, but I found that, because of its size I never took it along with me all the time and missed some great shots. So I bought the Canon SD1100IS to take with me all the time. I love this little camera. It's easy to hold, has more bells and whistles than the XT and takes great photos. I also love the movie clip feature and the large LCD screen (which I miss in the XT). I bought a case for it with a neck strap so that I don't have to carry it when I'm empty-handed. The downside of the camera is that I'm used to having an SLR with virtually no shutter lag, so it's hard to go back to having a camera with it. That means that I have to be careful when shooting moving objects so that they're always in the photo (which sometimes becomes an interesting dilemma). Although the camera has a slow shutter speed setting you can't really adjust the shutter speed. There are set features for kids and pets, night shots, foliage and even fireworks, but you're pretty locked into the shutter speed they select. That said, the camera performs beautifully and takes great photos, equal to that of the XT. A great buy for the money!
