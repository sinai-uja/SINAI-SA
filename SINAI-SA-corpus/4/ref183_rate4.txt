        canon A590IS, February 24, 2009
        ByF. Jeto "Fernando" (Las Vegas, NV USA)  - See all my reviews
I've only had the camera for 2 months now, I'm not a pro but i've owned point and shoot cameras before and so far this canon have exceeded my expectations. i read some bad reviews before i purchased this camera. but i think all you need to do is read the manual before using it to actually appreciate its very wide array of features..but if you're one of those people who likes to jump into the pool right away, i dont think this one is for you.
