What a great buy! Got a great looking, great functioning camera for a phenomenal price. Have been using it all over the place. The battery life is great. No need to buy any additional lithium batteries. Pic quality is good..prints sharp clear images. Like most other cameras, attempting to take quick back to back pictures seems to freeze and confuse the camera a little bit. But recovery is lightning fast.. within the second. When taking pics in dim light, need to change mode or pics come out dark.Light weight, easy to carry and fashionable. Overall a great buy!
