        Very easy to use 1st digital camera, June 29, 2005
        ByChip L "chip1978" (Little Rock, AR)  - See all my reviews
When I got this camera out of the box, I was taking pictures in minutes without even reading the instructions.  Don't get me wrong, I'll have to review the manual to do rapid series shots, night shots, or other shots that might be difficult.  So far, it's been incredibly easy to use and very intuitive.I'll echo the concern of at least one other reviewer - I strongly recommend against installing the Kodak software.  You should have no problem simply connecting the camera to a USB port and transferring images and video.  After installing Kodak's software, my computer crashed.
