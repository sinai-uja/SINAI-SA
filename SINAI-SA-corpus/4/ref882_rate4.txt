I give all the credit to my wife for finding this camera.  I needed a new camera and she came to my rescue!  All I wanted was something easy to use and compact.  Well, to my surprise I got the PowerShot SD1100IS and it is great!  More pixels than I need, yet a perfect size for travel.  My boss has the SD1000 and he loves his camera...but definitely took interest in mine.  I have a 4GB card, very necessary for a frequent snapshot like myself.  All in all, the size was right and the pictures are great.  Perfect for a high-time traveler like myself.
