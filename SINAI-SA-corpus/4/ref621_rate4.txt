        good bang for your buck...PC mag's editor's choice, March 27, 2007
        ByTonya N. Krueger "nixter83" (los angeles, ca)  - See all my reviews
don't fight it.  you will look around, drive yourself crazy and incessantly read reviews.  there's always going to be something bigger and better but for the price, this is a sweet little (not so little i guess) camera.  i'm still figuring out all of the functions, but the macro mode, color accent, and stitch assist are very neat and make creative photography a snap!  also, i got a rechargable docking battery charger made by energizer that allows you to charge 8 batteries in 2 removable "pods" so you can always be prepared--battery life is excellent (makes up for the bulky size).  i'm leaving for mexico in a few weeks and i can't wait to take this little guy with me.  i was debating a for a while whether or not to get the a640 instead, but many reviews have said that it's not worth the 80 or so more bucks. i figured that i'd go for the cheaper, identical version (besides the MPs) b/c it's a PC magazine eidtor's choice and overall customer satisfaction is higher for the a630.  i'm still toying with the idea of getting an underwater case, but i probably won't because of the design flaws and huge pricetag...we'll see though, taking the camera in the water would be amazing.  just realize that not every camera has everything (i wish this one had image stabilizaiton and a better flash), but for the price, you make out like a bandit! happy shooting:)
