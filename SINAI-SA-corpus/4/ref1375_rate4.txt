I just got this Kodak Z740 5MP camera for Christmas after reading the reviews on Amazon.com and am very impressed. The picture quality is crisp and clear. I had a Cannon and while it took nice quality pictures, it was so difficult to interpret the various menus. Kodak has done a wonderful job of laying out the menu in such a simple way. It is easy to use and you dont have to wait 5 seconds for the picture to snap either. I highly recommend this camera. The only negative point I have to make is that the lens cover comes off too easily, so make sure you get a good camera case to protect the lens cover from being bumped.
