        Excellent pocket camera with an unfortunate video recording format, October 29, 2008

This is a fantastic pocket camera that takes great photos and really good quality movies. Most of the other reviews accurately rave about this. Here is what I don't like: Canon, in my opinion, made a poor choice with their movie file format (AVI). I was in the market for a compact photo/video camera that I can easily carry with me for those casual evenings in the park with my 18 month old toddler or settings where you might not need HD quality video or SLR like capabilities. My SLR (Canon Digital Rebel XT) and my video camera (Sony HDR-SR5) were too bulky to lug around for such occasions. I was considering Flip Video Camcorder, but that seemed to lack good photo qualities. Since most of my family lives far away, I also wanted the ability to easily share my home videos on sites such as youtube.Movie mode records in AVI which results in HUGE files. They should have used MPEG (H.264)that uses compression while almost retaining the movie quality. A 35 second movie takes up approximately 68 MB of space whereas after conversion to another format such as WMV (using windows movie maker), it takes only 4 MB with an almost unnoticeable quality loss to my untrained eye. The implications of choosing AVI over MPG (or other compressed file type) are:1. Your memory card will fill up in no time (an empty 2GB card will allow 16 minutes of video)2. You will have to convert it (compress) your video before you can upload a 5 minute video to youtube.I understand that this is a camera and not a camcorder, but a simple change of format would make this device almost flawless!
