        Great Alone; Bad for Digiscoping, November 10, 2002

I have had the Coolpix 5700 since July 2002, and I am delighted with the photos I have taken and the compliments I have received on them.  I have taken some stunning photos and printed them onto 8 x 10 photo paper with incredible results.  I've even blown up tiny portions of pictures without any pixels becoming visible when printed!  The Coolpix has a number of features that make it a great camera, but it also has some drawbacks.The 5700 has several different user modes that can be preprogrammed for different situations.  The auto modes are well-programmed if you don't want to set these items manually.  The auto-focus has several different settings (i.e. spot, matrix) and a manual override that comes in handy for photographing minute items such as spider webs that are too thin for the autofocus to see.  The 8X optical zoom is great for setting up shots without having to move.  The biggest drawback I have found with the 5700 is that it is useless for digiscoping.  I have a Swarovski spotting scope through which I want to take pictures (bird watching, etc.), but because of the size of the lens on the 5700, my pictures have severe vignetting.  If you want a great camera for digiscoping, I recommend the 4500.  Another disappointment is that the 5700 does not have the panorama assist feature that the 4500 has.  Overall, the picture quality and settings for the 5700 are great, but it has a couple of drawbacks depending on what you want to do with the camera.
