If you're an amateur or professional photographer, this camera is for you. It has point and shoot with auto mode, adjustable white balance, ISO, and lots of scene modes. It has 10x zoom to get up close and personal, with 5x more digital zoom (though it's not recommended you use digital zoom much as it pixellates your image).PROS:- 10x zoom- Fast shooting- Lots of scene modesCONS:- Flash pops up every time you turn it on- Viewfinder is electronic
