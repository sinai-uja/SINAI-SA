Takes excellent pictures usually. If the picture is not perfect, it is usually a focus problem. The swing out LCD is too small, low res and nearly worthless. The electronic viewfinder could be better. If you want to use the manaul focus its hard to tell when you have it focused accurately because the viewfinder isnt very sharp and there are no measurements (feet or meters) of distance, just a sliding bar. Zoom lens is great. Macro mode (close ups)  is outstanding. No low light flash assist. You will need an extra battery and a bigger memory card so put that in your budget if you go for this expensive baby! If you can live without the 8x zoom lens, there are probably better choices where you can get more camera for less money. Otherwise just bite the bullet and try not to whine too much like I do.
