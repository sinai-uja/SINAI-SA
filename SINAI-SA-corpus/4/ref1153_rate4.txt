        Great camera, poor customer service, July 12, 2004

I love my kodak easy share camera. It is a good camera for the price. However, just a warning, if you have a problem with your camera, kodak has very poor customer service and is unwilling to help you fix your problem. You will have to take care of it on your own at a local dealership.
