Pictures of wildflowers, both distance and close-ups were found to be quite comparable to those taken with my 10x optical Kodak camera.  A "stitched" photo of the USS Ronald Reagan came out well.  My only objection to the camera's features it that it doesn't have a viewfinder (very useful when in full sunlight and the screen is hard to see).
