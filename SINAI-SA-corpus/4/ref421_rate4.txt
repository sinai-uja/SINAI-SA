        Great Camera for everyone - Look no further, March 26, 2007
        ByRamana M. Chada "rcmax" (Northern Virginia)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera lastweek and also a 1GB Lexar media card. Products arrived in 3 days of placing the order. The camera comes with a basic manual and an advanced one, the latter is intimidating on the first look. Just go with the basic manual initially to familiarize yourself with all the controls and within 1 hour you are ready to shoot your first pictures. The quality of pictures is excellent, in both night mode and Auto mode which you will mostly be using. The zoom is so good that on one of the pics clicked on a really cloudy evening I could read the lience plate of a truck that was about 50 yards away. I must have shot only 20 pics in the last 4 days that I have the camera, mostly test pictures under various conditions and I have no reason to complain.For a semi-pro, there are lot more options that the camera provides to control the shutter speed, aperture, pixellation and many many things which I probably will rarely ( or even never) use. If you have Windows XP, downloading the pictures from the SD card is easy. You don't even need to install the CD that comes with the camera ( I did'nt), just use the "Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006" s/w that comes as part of XP.The menus are quite intutive but there is room for some improvement here. The advanced manual could have been written in a more friendly way not to scare a non-technial mind.
