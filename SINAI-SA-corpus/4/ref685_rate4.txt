        Easy to use, and great pictures, July 4, 2007

I bought this camera just before a trip to Central Asia, and had little time to get used to it before leaving.  But even without knowing how to use all the bells and whistles, it still did a fine job.  The only adjustments I used were varying degrees of zoom, flash on or off, and closeup on or off -- and all these are easy to manage (and to remember).  The camera is compact and easy to hold.  Rechargeable batteries lasted through many, many shots -- I recharged every 2 or 3 days, and never had a problem. Eight megapixels give photos that can be "taken apart": pulling out an interesting face or object, and blowing it up as a separate picture.  Also, with this degree of resolution, it's hard to tell where optical zoom leaves off and digital zoom begins.Only two criticisms:  first, the lag time between pushing the shutter button and actually taking the picture (and I think all digitals are plagued by this). Second, it's easy to accidentally twist the dial on the camera top when pulling it out of a bag or case, and it's hard to remember to always check to see that it's set correctly.Overall, though, a very good camera for the price -- I'm well-satisfied.
