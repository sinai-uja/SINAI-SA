        Coolpix 5700, June 8, 2003
        ByRichard Wilson (China)  - See all my reviews
Whilst the quality of this camera is excellent in daylight, the damn flash did not work - brand new too! Still waiting for it to be resolved.I have heard other customers complaining about this too, so be warned.The autofocus is a bit annoying as it hunts around, whirring and clicking.The actual photo's (not been able to try the flash) are excellent, and the features are awesome.It takes a bit of searching and hunting to navigate through the complex menu structure, and the battery life is too low especially when you are first using it to try and understand what it can do.Maybe worth getting a mains adaptor.The memory card supplied is a bit stingy, and should be at least 128 instead of 32, and the standard package didn't even come with a carry case.I am quite new to photography in general, so my knowledge of all of the sttings is quite limited, however, when the flash is fixed and I have bought a couple more batteries, I may be able to give it a better review.I am not impressed that Nikon can ship defective units especially when you are paying around 1000US
