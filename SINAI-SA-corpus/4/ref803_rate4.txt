        Unexpectedly better than expected-love this shade of gold, November 27, 2008

I own an Elph SD450 5MP, which I thought nothing could beat for the quality of pictures and movie clips it took. I ordered this one to update my camera and was not disappointed. Canon photos tend to be bluish or dark but that is easily corrected in the computer or with the camera settings. I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity of photos, particularly when using the standard zoom. I also like the movie mode which has been improved over my 450. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I hoped it was more compact, but it is a tad thicker and bigger all around than the 450. Still, it's a great camera to keep in a purse or briefcase in case the perfect photo opportunity should present itself.
