        great digital camera with a few flaws, September 26, 2005

My first foray into the digital camera world was also with a Kodak brand. I loved that camera, until I loaned it out and it came back ruined.  The model was unfortunately discontinued, so I scouted all brands, but ended up back with Kodak and this particular model. Selling points - (1) the price for a 5MP was very competitive; (2) the 10x zoom is amazing; (3) it comes with a great variety of photo-enablers which are very helpful to the point (4) if the 10x capability isn't enough for you addtional lenses can be added.  Drawbacks - (1) the size, I thought that it was smaller than it is, but with the 10x lens apparatus, it gets bulky; (2) a bit big and an awkward shape for storing in a backpack for quick access; (3) the lens cover is a drag, it doesn't stay on! - a better design would be one of those automatic lens close-ups.But, nonetheless, this is a fine camera for people who want an excellent value, many features and top quality pictures.
