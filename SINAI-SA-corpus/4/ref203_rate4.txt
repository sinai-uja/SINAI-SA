        Seems like a great deal., February 18, 2009
        ByShel in IA (Central Iowa, USA)  - See all my reviews
So I picked up this camera for just over a hundred dollars... I've been very impressed with all that I've seen and read about it, but I have yet to manage anything spectacular with it myself. (Most likely a user issue, and not a product issue.) I was easily able to locate a cheap memory card for it that had no compatibility issues. I hope after our upcoming trip to Mexico that I can submit some great photos I hope I am able and capable of taking!
