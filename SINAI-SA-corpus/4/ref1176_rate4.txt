        Kodak CX7430, June 27, 2004
        ByChristopher Wettach "cmw from rochester" (Rochester, NY United States)  - See all my reviews
Although it lacks a German lens, this unit provided crisp clear close-ups.  Very easy to use for the most part.  Display is bright and menu commands are logically arranged.
