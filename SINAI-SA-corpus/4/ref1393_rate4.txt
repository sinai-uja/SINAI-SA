        Nice price on a pretty decent camera., February 17, 2006
        ByKevan J. Angel (Denver, CO USA)  - See all my reviews
As someone who is mainly taking pictures of my family for memories sake, I was looking for a camera with around 5 mega pixels and a zoom lens.  The z740 had the features I was looking for, and didn't cost a bundle.  So far, I am very satisfied with the quality of pictures that it takes, however THERE ARE DOWNSIDES.  First it takes a while to boot up, not forever, but for a guy like me who is used to a quick film camera, it seems like forever.  And the power saving feature (which I do believe is mostly a good thing) requires you to restart the camera after a few minutes of not shooting. Then when it's time for a picture.. oops you have to turn it on.   This feature can be turned off, but then you waste battery life. Also the write speed seems a bit slow. Overall I think THE PROCESSOR IS A BIT SLUGGISH.  Another problem is that the screen is pretty small. You probably wouldn't notice this unless you compare it to it's more expensive counterparts. Finally, the whole Kodak EasyShare thing is really retarded. It does for your camera what AOL does to the internet. That is it limits you to using it's software, it's website etc. If you know how to use a computer, my advice to you is don't install the software!  Overall, for a novice photographer who wants to make great prints this is a good buy.
