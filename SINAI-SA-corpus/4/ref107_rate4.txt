[[ASIN:B0011ZCDKS Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom]. This is a great camera for the casual user. I bought this camera for my wife and she absolutely loves it! The new "easy function" mode is great! She even commented on how fast the camera takes mulitple shots compared to our old Sony Cybershot. Also, the full price including sh was still $30-40 cheaper on Amazon compared to Circuit City and other electronic stores.  We only had one slight drawback, the battery life.  We used the AA batteries that came with the camera and after using the camera throughout the day from 10 am till 6 pm the low battery light came on. Fortunatley, we had an extra set of batteries and continued to enjoy taking pictures.Overall, for the price, ease of use, the quality of pictures produce, this is a great camera!  Great Buy! Get it and you will love it!
