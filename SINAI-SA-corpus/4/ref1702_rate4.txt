        So far so good , April 28, 2008

This was my first digital camera so I have not fully mastered the learning curve yet, but what I see so far is good. I found I could download pics without the Olympus software which is great. I discovered that I cannot see through the viewfinder AT ALL when trying to take outdoor pics - how do I fix that?!?!? It is like shooting blind for heavens sake. Resolution on pics is AWESOME. I gave it a dunk and it performed as advertised. Tough to find accessories but hopefully that will improve with time. I dislike being forced into Olympus brand accessories and need a car charger too but no luck so far. Guess that comes with jumping on a totally new camera very early on
