        Still feeling it out., January 19, 2009

This is a great camera for those who aren't looking for a camera to take action pictures in low light.I only say that as the flash takes so long to get ready you might miss your next shot. Picture quality is great!You couldn't ask for better pictures.I personally love this cammera so far, but then I've only had it for a month so I might find other things I don't like. Oh and as with all digital cameras, use rechargeable batteries as this one goes through them like all the rest.I think that for an everyday shooter, you can't ask for a better camera for the money.So I recommend this camera to anyone who needs a camera for that purpose which is why I bought it myself.
