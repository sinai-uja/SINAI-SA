Good choice for gift to a casual user. We wanted to buy a DSLR but the prices are still too high. We have seen pictures from another Canon 8MP and they were great. This camera will do until the person we gave the camera to is ready to upgrade to a DSLR. I do wish the zoom were better (ie; 10X or above) - but for the price....
