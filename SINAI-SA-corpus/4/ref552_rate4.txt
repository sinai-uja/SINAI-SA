        Nice Camera for the Money, January 13, 2007

The camera is very easy to use once you get used to the buttons and choices for enhancing your pictures.  It seemed a bit awkward at first, but I believe it was just my becoming familiar with it.  The software loaded without any problems and downloading the pictures is a snap.  I'm very satisfied with the picture quality and features that I didn't have with my old Canon.  Very good choice for the casual picture taker.
