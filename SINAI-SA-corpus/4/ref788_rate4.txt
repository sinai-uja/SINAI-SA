        Good Price, Good Camera, January 1, 2009

For $159 you really can't beat this camera. It is easy to use and perfect for the Mom or Dad who just wants good photos of their family. I really like the auto correct red eye feature. It doesn't get everyone everytime, but 8 of 10 isn't too bad. I had cannon with a lot more features and decided to step down to this one after I dropped it on the floor. I found I never used the features and the SD1100 seems to have pretty much all I will ever need. I think technology is advancing so quick I will probably want a new camera or drop this one in 2 years and it didn't seem worth the extra money for all the bells and whistles.
