        ByEduardo Del Valle "Pulpo" (Lima, Peru)  - See all my reviews
I was looking for MY first Digital camera, were I work we have several brand and models, but this one has most of the features that the more expensive models have. The 10x zoom is awesome! Dream machine. Easy to use programs for the average user and lots of options for the over average one.I do lots of sports and I love the multi frame capabilities of the camera, 2 frames per seccond and can either take the first or the last 4 so you can pick the best one. 0.4 secconds per picture and if you use an additional memory the internal serves as cache so you can keep taking pictures while the camera saves them. Be aware that the flash only works in the first picture under frame mode.I can tell that it has a really fast proccessor unit because when  I review a picture and I play with the zoom and the pan it does it really fast. The overall response of the machine is quick.I would love to have the histogram, but not available, if you really need it buy the Z7590, it does have it.
