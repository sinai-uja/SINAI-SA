        Using the NIKON 5700 Digital Camera, January 14, 2003

Yes the Nikon 5700 does everything it is supposed to do and it takes wonderful pictures.   But there are limitations.  The control buttons are very lite to the touch and you are apt to at the wrong resolution, speed,  or image count if you accidently touch the controls.     Also the camera takes many seconds to focus automatically and you are apt to lose an important image.   The telephoto controls are difficult to use accurately.Again, for great pictures, it is a great camera, but there are limitations and it can be difficult to use.    But I would buy it again.
