        Worth the money, June 5, 2007

Bought this in a haste as I as planning an trip to an outdoor location and did not have a camera. Result: Very much satisfied...Pros and Cons are below:+ves: Performs its prmiary function very well that is takes amazingly clear picures, the rotating LCD screen adds a lot of flexibility and helps us take pics in any position.-ves: Requires 4 AA batteries and is hence a bit bulky, also batteries are sucked out very quickly (keep a spare set in case the charger is not handy) I am also not very sure of its capability when the light is not good, maybe a bit of fine tune is needed from my side...Over all worth the money, and I cannot complain given the amount I paid for it...
