Price and delivery were excellent.  Based on early experience, the camera produces the expected, sharp images.  Disappointingly, the camera display, in low light conditions, is very grainy -- noticeably more so than my older model Canon PowerShot.  I called Canon technical support who told me that this is typical with this camera. Nonetheless, photographs taken in low light conditions remain sharp and clear.
