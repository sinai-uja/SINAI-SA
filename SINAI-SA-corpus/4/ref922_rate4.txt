        Very Nice Camera/Printer easy to use, January 22, 2009

I was excited to receive the camera and printer in a bundle package. What was a little upsetting was when I looked to find the ink replacement on the printer, it could only be purchased on line. I went to three major stores that carry ink and they all said that the printer was too new and they did not carry the ink replacement. I ordered two on line and now I am ready to go. The camera is sleek (read directions first) and I like the way the pictures have come out! Thanks-
