        Great purchase for its purpose., July 7, 2008

Great camera if you want/need a waterproof/shockproof camera.The image quality for pictures taken outdoors is great. But it is really not good for indoor pictures with high ISOs, the pictures becomes extremely pixelated and grainy. I wish they had used a better processor for higher ISO pictures. But if waterproof is the ultimate goal this is definitely the way to go. I took some great pictures underwater and outdoors in general.  Nice size and robust built. High recommend for its purpose but if artistic/great shots is your goal, go for a DSLR. This is a bit pricey too, and I got it because I broke my last two cameras because of water spills.
