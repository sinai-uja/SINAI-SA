        Great camera - horrible software!, January 27, 2008
        ByGary Eckhardt (San Antonio, TX USA)  - See all my reviews
I received the A630 for Christmas, and initially I loved the camera.  It is very intuitive, takes great photos, and the battery life seems to be fantastic.  However, my first experience with the Canon software included left much to be desired.  First off, the software suite is huge - over 300Meg for the complete installation.  The software itself seems to be very well written and intuitive, but it has some severe limitations.  First off, you simply cannot access the memory card in the camera like a computer hard drive, something that every digital camera I've owned has let me do.  (Kodak, Nikon, Minolta, heck - even the no-name digital binoculars let me mount as a hard drive).  There doesn't seem to be any way to just mount the card as a drive.  So, stuck with using the software to extract photos from the camera, I came headlong into another severe limitation - the software does not recognize any hard drives on your PC that are network drives.  I have all my digital photos on a server, and I would be satisfied to simply use the software to transfer the photos, but not being able to see any network drives puts another step in the process - copying them to the local hard drive and then using windows file manager to copy to the network drive.  Canon support basically told me "the software does not support network drives" without offering any other suggestions.  I guess I'll have to fall back to buying a card reader (I have to get a new one that supports SDHD) and transferring photos that way.  I'm giving it four stars because the benefits of the camera being so good outweighs the software problems.
