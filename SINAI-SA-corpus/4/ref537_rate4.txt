        Lots of features, great pictures, just a rather large, September 5, 2007

This camera has a ton of features, is easy to use and takes great pictures.  The only drawback, and the single reason I returned it, is because it's rather larger for point and shoot.  If you're looking for something that'll slip into your shirt pocket, this ain't it.
