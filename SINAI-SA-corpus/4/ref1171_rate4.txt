        Great Digital Camera, September 25, 2005
        ByC. King "New Photographer" (Cleveland, Ohio)  - See all my reviews
I love my camera. It has many functions, video, and it is a very nice size. Not too small or too big. It's very great and you can share your pics with others. The picture is so clear it's unreal. I am sure there are better digital cameras out there, but for a person who has never had one and is just getting into picture taking and wants clarity, picture share and even printing from home...this is the one!
