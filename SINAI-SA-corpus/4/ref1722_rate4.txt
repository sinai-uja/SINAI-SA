This camera is a good camera for on the go.  Not the best but certainly not a loser.  the photo quality at distance is not great but for everyday use is fine.  In order to take video segments that are more than 10 seconds you need to buy the more expensive m+ card (which are not very fast) and download a patch that allow this camera to take long video segments.
