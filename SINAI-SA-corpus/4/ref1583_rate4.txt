I decided to purchase this particular camera for the shock + waterproof feature. I do a lot of backpacking/traveling. I wanted something that was small and durable, yet still  had good photo quality. I love the waterproof feature for around the beach or on the boat. Shockproof is good and I have tested it a couple of times accidentally. I am still learning to use all the features. My first trip using this camera was a couple week backpacking tour around the UK. Photos were good for the most part. The waterproof feature certainly came in handy as it poured rain most days. The menus are easy to navigate. My only real complaint is the positioning of the lens. You will find you get many shots with fingers in the corner. Overall I am pleased, It is exactly the rugged, small camera I was looking for. Price was excellent compared to other websites, and the shipping was fast.
