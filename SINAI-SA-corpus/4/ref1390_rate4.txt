        High-end features, good price...and a couple flaws, February 27, 2006
        ByChristopher Hansen "SFGOAKRFAN" (Sacramento, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
The Kodak Z740 was my first digital camera. I had experience using a Nikon SLR and various different Olympus, Canon, and Kodak models. I was looking for something with a good zoom, because I hate not being able to get a picture I want when I am too far away. This was the cheapest of the 10X+ optical zoom cameras that I found so I thought I would take look at it.Pros:1. 10X zoom2. a lot of shooting modes (4 main types, 12or so more in the SCN function and also manual PASM)3. Kodak color4. easy to use format5. comfortable feel6. good size screen (not great but very adequate)7. PRICE!Cons:1. Lens Cap (it has two big buttons which make it easy to remove but also is easily knocked off with the slightest pressure on even one button. 2. EVF is a bit grainy3. Burst mode is a bit slow and you tend to shoot blind (CNET review) but not a huge issue unless the object you are using the burst mode for is moving at a rapid pace and in an unpredicatable  direction. Will be interesting to see if the slowness improves when I recieve my high performance SD card.4. Perhaps the biggest flaw is the lack of image stabilization. The Higher end cameras in the same category to the Z740 all have it. If you ever try to shoot a moving target at 10X Zoom it could be very difficult. This feature is what makes this camera 4 instead of 5 stars. Unfortunately if you want image stabilization  it will most likely cost you $100 more for a camera with it and all the features this camera has.
