        Good little camera, May 4, 2008
        ByN. Scott Brown (Houston, TX USA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera for my wife who doesn't like complicated devices.  So far, she has been happy with it.  It is a little small to hold, but we have managed.  I especially like the color highlight feature, but I believe it is a novelty that might seldom get used.  We plan to use the camera on safari this summer - to capture close-up shots when my SLR has a long lens on it.
