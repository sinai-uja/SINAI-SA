I purchased this camera to take with me on a trip to the Bahamas primarily because I wanted something very compact that I could slip in my purse or pocket, so that I would always have it with me. This little camera definitely has exceeded my expectations, it takes beautiful shots and is almost as small as my cell phone. Very nice. would highly recommend.
