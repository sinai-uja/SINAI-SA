The camera works perfectly and is easy to use, as well as easy to set up the software on the PC.  The only downside may be the lack of image stabilzation.  Inside pictures using a flash were blurred on a number of shots, however that could be because the setting I was using was not the correct one or that I did not hold the down the shutter for focus before taking the picture.
