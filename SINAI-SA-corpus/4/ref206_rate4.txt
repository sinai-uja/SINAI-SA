        Canon A590 good point  shoot, February 17, 2009
        ByR. Mosier (California)  - See all my reviews
For an inexpensive point  shoot this camera is a good value.  It has sufficient resolution and image size for 8x10 prints.  The array of shooting modes covers most situations.  Two minor negatives: The menus are sometimes not intuitive and the "custom color" option is very limited.
