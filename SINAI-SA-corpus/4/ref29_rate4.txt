        Great little camera for the price, February 21, 2009

I saw all of the great reviews and thought I'd buy it - and I'm really glad I did. This camera takes detailed pictures in beautiful color. Very versatile. I'd consider myself a serious enthusiast when it comes to photography. Definitely buy a memory card - they're very reasonable from amazon.I ended up buying an HP photo printer as well - and it's fabulous. I uploaded a couple of photos I took with the camera.
