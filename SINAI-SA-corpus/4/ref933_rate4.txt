        Cool little camera, January 16, 2009
        Byamy (Los Angeles)  - See all my reviews
I think this is a pretty good camera for it's size.  It's takes clear pictures and decent videos.  I think it turns on fairly quick...which is great.  All the cannon's that i've used have a red light that appears before you take a shot, as does this one, so sometimes it bother's me, but not a big deal.  I think the quality of the battery/sd cover could be a little better because it doesn't feel very stern.  However, as a causal picture taker it's perfect for my purposes and i would recommend to others like me!
