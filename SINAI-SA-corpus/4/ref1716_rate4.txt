        Good camera, not problem free, January 11, 2009
        BySandman (Texas)  - See all my reviews
For the most part this is a good camera. I bought it for it's durability and compactness. The photos are quality, the camera is easy to use and it has a lot of nice photo options. Panarama mode is not perfect, but nice. You can edit photos right on the camera. This was a great purchase for what I wanted...a good second camera for extreme winter conditions. My complaints are the following: Battery life: By the end of the day, I was already getting a message battery was low...disappointment when you have to ration your photo selection. Speed of use: When you are in the SCN mode, everytime you turn the camera on, you have to confirm that you want that setting. I kept the camera in Landscape mode and everytime I turned it on, I had to answer "yes" I wanted to be in that mode. Also, any changes I made to this setting (like light balance), I had to reset every time I turned the camera on. Also, the flip open cover is nice, but it easily slides open and turns the camera on as you slide it into your pocket.Don't get me wrong. I am satisfied with the camera all around, these are minor complaints (except battery life).
