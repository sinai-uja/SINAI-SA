        All depends on what you are using it for, April 22, 2008

This is my first digital camera. I made the transition from a high quality 35mm slr for the ease of photographing stained glass and jewelry for my web sites. With traditional film it was costing a small fortune for supplies and processing not to mention being disappointed with the results of photographing glass. I had to overshoot with the hope a glass panel would turn out correct. Glass is a very difficult medium to capture accurately. Digital just made sense having instant results. It worked great for the glass panels but I am not pleased with pics of my jewelry. This application requires more close up shots for detail. The auto focus seems unpredictable and I end up with a great many of my pictures being out of focus. I have to shoot quite a few pics to get a couple of keepers. I suspect this is not this cameras' specialty. I use it outside and it takes an excellent photo. Normal indoor photos, like Thanksgiving, with the flash is fine also. So it all depends on what you are going to use it for.
