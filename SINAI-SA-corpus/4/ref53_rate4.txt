        Works Great.........., February 5, 2009

I purchased this Camera through Amazon for my 11 year old son a month ago.  The lighting on the LCD screen is great for both pictures and video.  The camera can take up to a maximum 4MB SD Card which is fine for my son to make short videos and edit them on a computer. It's also nice having the option of using the LCD screen or the "old school" view finder to take the picture.  I would have given this a 5 star rating if the outer casing was made of metal instead of plastic.  I hope it will hold up for an 11 year old boy. All in all my son and I are both very happy with it and it is very easy for him to use and thumb his way through the internal software.
