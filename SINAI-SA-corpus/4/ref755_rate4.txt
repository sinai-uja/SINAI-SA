I am not reviewing the printer here, just the camera.  The images captured by the canon powershot sd1100 is are of better quality than any of the other point and shoots I have used.  Canon is my perfered brand of DSLR's as well.  The camera is nice and small and fits easily into any pocket.  It is fairly easy to use.  If you want to take decent pictures at a decent price this is the camera I would recommend.
