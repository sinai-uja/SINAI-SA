Overall I'm very pleased with the Z740.  In good lighting conditions everything works great.  This camera is made for outside shots on a sunny day.  But if you're inside with poor light you might run into a few problems with the zoom.  It will take 5+ seconds to focus and even then the picture might turn out a little fuzzy.  Don't get me wrong, the flash is very powerful.  If you're not zoomed in it will take a perfect picture in complete darkness!  The only other complaint I have is the lens cap will not stay on.  Make sure you tie it to the strap or you'll probably end up loosing it.Lastly, the easyshare software that's included is great.  Very easy to use and the options they give you to improve the quality of the picture actually work.  I have paint shop pro X and it can't do some of the stuff the free Kodak program can.
