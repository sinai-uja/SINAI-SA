Its a handy light weight little camera. Pop in a couple of fresh AA batteries you are ready to take pictures. You don't have to worry about finding an availble usb plug on your computer or waiting for the batteries to change. Its not just point and click and get good pictures with this camera but if you read the manual and get familar with it you can take some very nice pictures.
