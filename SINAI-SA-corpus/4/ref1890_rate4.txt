        improvement over the 100D, May 8, 2008

I was given a gift of the Pentax100D not a year ago; in March I tried to buy the same camera for my son. It was already out of stock and replaced by the 200D which had combined features of the 100D with the 10D now also obsolete. In comparing the two cameras one can see the improvements in the newer camera: instead of 6 megapixels this camera has 10 megapixels, an advantage for the serious camera buff who wants to have safe blow ups larger than 8x 10. The switch to RAW format is also more easily accomplished than on the 100D. Additionally, while the ISO ratings on the 100D go from 200-3200, the 200D starts at 100, an advantage in bright light, although the maximum rating is 1600--on the theory I suppose that it might be more desirable to have more flexibility in high light scenarios than need it for very low light situations. Another improved feature is the viewing screen on the back of the body. It is fractionally larger than the 100D but it improves clarity. I didn't have a chance to examine all of the improvements in viewing and adjusting the camera however there are more editing features on the 200D than the 100D.I was also delighted to see that every old lens my son had including an old Pentax doubler, worked fine with this camera. There was enough of a difference that, although I really like my camera, I wish I had the features I listed above of the newer one. The only drawback is the price; it was $100 higher at the same time this year than the 100D was last year, +/- $760 with lens and body-- although as I have been tracking the camera the price has been dropping and I got the 200D on a promotion, but it was still higher than I wanted to pay at the outset.
