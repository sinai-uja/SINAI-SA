        Nice, but could be better for the money, July 29, 2004
        ByPhotoFogey (Western NY)  - See all my reviews
I've had the camera about a year, and have used it extensively for nature photography with good success, particularly for macro work. The swiveling viewscreen is particularly useful for shooting stuff close to the ground (bugs and flowers, usually), and the long zoom is great for animal and bird shots. I usually shoot in jpeg mode at the highest resolution, with 128 mb of memory.  There are a few deficiencies, things that should be better in in a camera that's that expensive:  The lens could be sharper, especially at long zoom settings. Comparing similar shots from another long zoom digital that sells for half the price, the cheaper camera was noticably sharper.  Battery life is poor, less than half the life I get with another camera that uses four NIMH AA's.  Both the viewfinder and view screen could be brighter. When shooting in sunlight, it's pretty much a guessing game to compose a shot. I've resigned myself to shooting lots of exposures and sorting them out after downloading to the computer.  Autofocus doesn't work very well in macro mode, and, with the dim viewscreen, manual focus is pretty much impossible.  I still like the camera, it's excellent for family pictures, scenics, and the more mundane stuff, but comes up a bit short when you push its capabilities. More and more I'm using the other digital camera I own for macro work (it has a dedicated super macro mode), and get about an 80 percent yield of acceptable pictures, compared to maybe 50 percent with the Nikon 5700.
