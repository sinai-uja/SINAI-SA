The camera is great, and the pictures turn out awesome! I have gotten so many compliments on the physical appearance of it. The only thing I am not so fond of the camera about it when i press the shutter button, it focuses itself and then flashes. So, for me it is too much of a delay when taking the picture. Other than that I love the camara and the quality of my pics.
