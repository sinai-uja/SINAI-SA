This is probably the best bang for the buck camera out there today.  Pros:Fantastic image qualityFeatures offer lots of user controlTight macro mode8 Mega Pixels offers lots of post processing options4X optical zoomGreat battery life Uses AA batteries (4)Sturdy lightweight constructionSwivel LCD is shweetPrice/performance ratioCons:Poor low light performance (need tripod or flash)ISO 400 and 800 have too much noise to be usable6X optical zoom would be niceJPEG compression No RAW No battery meter
