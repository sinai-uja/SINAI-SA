        Love my camera!, January 9, 2007

I love everything I have so far figured out with my camera.  I haven't spent the time to really look into or use any special features.  But I can tell you having the flip out screen is really nice.  I can have my camera up high but still see what's in my lense by simply tilting the screen down. Also it helps because  I can turn it inward therefore further protecting it from scratches or the hands of my little children.  I would recommend this camera to anyone, especially those that take the time to read all the info about special features.  (cause I know it has lots of them)
