Pros: small enough for one hand, good picture quality especially for the indoors if you choose the indoor mode, big LCD display give me better idea whether to save or delete a picture.Cons: you need to wait for longer time than you expect between two shots for a canon product. However, you can choose the triple shots in one time.
