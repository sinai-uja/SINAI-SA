Pros: The zoom on this camera is really nice, digital zoom is better than I expected, many manual options, small file size, good battery life, good color, good quality movies, 2 AA batteries. I have used it for 2 months with no major problems. Minor Cons: Lens cap comes off easily, Too much redeye indoors. Flash is back far on the camera, which can cause the light to be blocked on close up macro shots, No image stabilizer.
