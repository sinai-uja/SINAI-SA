For me, just about any camera would be a suitable upgrade.  I am replacing a 2004 edition of a Kodak EasyShare LS743.  However, the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS exceeds expectations.  I tried others in its competitive set (e.g. Nikon, Kodak and Fuji) and although initially the Canon is not the easiest to figure out, the end results are rewarding.  The face recognition feature, when activated, really helps improve the clarity of the picture and the image stabilization is a helpful tool.  Consumer Reports and the New York Times rated it a best buy and I agree.  I am taking less pictures to the get picture results I want.  Enjoy.
