This is my 2nd Canon camera.  This model the 1100 IS truly is a wonderfully built and nice looking blue camera that conveniently can be placed in my pants pocket without my really feeling that it is there.  I can have it with me all the time.  Picture quality is very good.  My older Canon SD300 still is a great camera but this one the 1100 IS has many features that my SD 300 does not have.  I am very happy with both of them although I am happier with the 1100 IS and would gladly recommend it.   Buying it from Amazon was the best deal and the delivery was fast.  I always check with Amazon for priceing, and also read the reviews from others to determine how good a product is.  I initially heard of this model from Consumer Reports and read their very positive rating on this model camera.  The price from Amazon was better than ebay and Costco!
