This is my first venture into buying a digital ... stepping stone of sorts.  I'm an avid fan of film SLRs so this was quite a difference for me.  However, I have been impressed with the camera.  It has a number of features come in handy and most are relatively easy to get to with a few clicks of a button.  Flash recovery is better with lithium batteries.  It's a great little point and shoot camera for the on-the-go person.
