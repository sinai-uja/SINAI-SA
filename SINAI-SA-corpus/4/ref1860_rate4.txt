        Brings a lot to play with, May 15, 2008
        Byurbandive (Paris, France)  - See all my reviews
I'm not a pro photographer, but my transition from a film reflex to a compact digital a few years ago was painful, I missed too much being able to bend the traditional limits of cameras, especially to take night pics. I finally convinced myself to get "good" digital camera. I hesitated a long time between the SLR-quality Sigma DP1, the tiny Olympus E-420 and this Pentax. The reasons for my final choice were a) the great first reviews, b) the quality of the build and "ruggedness" of the camera (seals, AA batteries), c) the availability of pancake lenses to limit bulkiness.I've had the camera for a week now. The first images came out beautiful and sharp. I also like the camera's programmability (define what each button does) and I think there is a lot to win by reading the manual thoroughly. At the moment I'm taking most pictures in RAW + JPG and fine-tuning the raw image if I think it deserves it, but I like the raw button which allows you to switch easily between file formats.Because I like tuning things myself, I don't use most of the "easy" functions, but they hardly ever are in my way.Overall, if you're going for a reflex, want good quality and don't mind a couple newbie-like features, I really recommend this camera.
