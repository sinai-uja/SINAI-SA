This is my second time purchasing this camera. I have one for myself, and I bought this one for my son. I love the fact that it uses AA batteries, so I can carry extra and not find myself with no battery power. Also, it has the little eye view finder, which is very rare in digital cameras, so I don't have to worry about screen white-out. I would've rated it 5-star if I didn't have to wait so long between taking pictures, but to be honest, that's been a problem with every digital camera I've owned. This one is my favorite.
