        Great camera but..., January 8, 2009

Got it for my wife and she love the color (of course) and how compact it is.However, when zoom out all the way @ f2.8, all the four corners are dark, and quite apparent, unless the scence is very well lit, you need to zoom in abit like 1-2 f-stop @ ~f3.1-3.5 to actually not have that happens!We used to have the SD500 and loved that until that got stolen/lost.
