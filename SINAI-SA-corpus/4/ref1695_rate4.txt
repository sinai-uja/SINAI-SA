        A very good sport camera, June 9, 2008

I just returned from a kayaking and white water rafting trip in Colorado.  I bought this camera when my last digital stopped working after a trip to the beach.  I wanted to make sure that didn't happen again and I liked the fact that the 1030SW is waterproof/dustproof/freezeproof/shockproof.  As advertised it was exactly suited to my trip.  I'm happy to report that the camera worked out fine.  Even after being knocked about and complteely submerged it still took wonderful pictures and is none the worse for wear.  The pictures are not as crisp as I thought a 10 MP camera would be and there are undoubtedly better cameras available.  But if you have an active lifestyle that includes snorkling, rafting, or other chalenging environments, then this is a perfect choice.  Better a very good picture with this camera than no pictures and maybe no camera with something less durable.
