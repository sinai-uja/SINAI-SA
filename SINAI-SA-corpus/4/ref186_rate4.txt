I am happy with this little camera. It is a good improvement over the last model. I got it for a little bit less this time around. It must be because, a year later cameras are much cheaper. I recommend getting the package with the battery charger. I am running out of batteries quickly because I like to review all pictures I take and I view them in the camera before I decide to keep it or chuck it.
