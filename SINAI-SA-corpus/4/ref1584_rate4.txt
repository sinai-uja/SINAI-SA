        Good All Around, September 30, 2008
        ByA. Machado (NJ, USA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera primarily for its waterproof, dustproof, and almost indestructible make. Let's make it clear that I am no professional photographer, but I do see some problems with this camera which would easily make me replace it for something else. The 10 megapixels made it an ever better deal since you can enjoy your pictures up on a big screen, but here is the biggest problem with this stylus. The images don't look quite as nice as you would expect from a 10 megapixel camera. Some appear really grainy, others too dark or washed, and others have chromatic aberrations. I have minimized all of these by tweaking some of the setting in the camera, and have found that the auto setting is only good up to a certain point. Also, higher isos reveal very grainy and washed-out pictures - setting it at 200 and 400 have given me near perfect shots. Sometimes I don't feel comfortable switching it around according to the lighting, so I just go with the preset modes - and there are a whole lot of them which also give very good images.While the picture quality was really upsetting at first, once I went snorkeling my doubts about the Stylus 1030 SW completely dispersed. This camera goes where no other can go, and the pictures and movies underwater made for some good time.I definitely recommend it if you're looking for something fun, durable and with good picture quality. However, if you're looking for great picture quality then you're better off going with other models or even an expensive SLR.* This stylus also has the Olympus Panorama function which takes picture in a phenomenal panoramic view. One of the other reasons why I bought it, and it was definitely worth it.
