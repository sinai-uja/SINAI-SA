        It may have been a long wait, but it doesn't disappoint, December 15, 2006
        ByJ. R. McDonald (Boca Raton, FL)  - See all my reviews
Well, I've been holding out on making the switch from film SLR's to DSLR's mainly because I can get higher quality digital images with film and my halfway decent film scanner.  I've adored Pentax since beginning with the K1000. I decided, finally, to make the switch when I heard Pentax would be coming out with their own advanced amateur DSLR, something to rival the Nikons and Canons out there.   I ordered my K10D over the weekend and got it 2 days ago.   I've take it out in and havve taken around 300-400 images so far, mostly testing out the various modes and settings and trying to get a feel for all of the settings.   Even in the less-than-ideal conditions brought on by overcast skies and low-lighting conditions, the camera has performed outstandingly.  The images come out sharp and with great color.  The Shake Reduction(SR) is an amazing feature to have built into the body.  It is a wonderful feature when using my new telephoto lens, particularly on these low-light days that I've been contending with.   I'm impressed with the white balance modes, though I have not been particularly impressed with the Auto WB with the low-lighting conditions.   I find that have to manually adjust the white balance in certain conditions, but these auto features aren't ever completely perfect. The layout of the camera is well designed and I have bee very happy with the controls.   The camera feels solid and reliable in every respect.   As I get more practice with using the camera, I'll happily update this review with what I've learned and any extra pros or cons I discover.
