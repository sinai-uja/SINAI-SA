        For the price..., July 13, 2006

This is only really the second digital camera that I have had much experience with, and so far it has been the best. It has always been a personal dream of mine to own a "real" camera that I could carry everywhere with me and shoot great pics at a moments notice, and so far this camera fits the bill perfectly. It has been over a week now that I have owned it and in that time I have taken well over 300 pictures, and in the process driven my wife nuts. The only complaints that I could offer up for this camera are that it will burn through a set of batteries fairly quick and when using it for a night shot unless it is stabilized pretty well ( with tripod ) the shots may come out a little blurry. Other than that I couldn't ask for anything more in a "first" camera. With the availability of additional lenses and a surprising amount of accessories you still have room to grow with this model. The menus are extremely easy to access and settings as easy to adjust. I purchased the 512MB SD card with mine which should keep you shooting for some time until you have to transfer files. With mine at 5MP quality it will hold approximately 320 pictures, not to mention regular ( quicktime ) video with sound. While it may not keep up with the big money "professional" cameras I think it would be a great deal for any other aspiring "hobbyist" such as myself. Be sure and check out the sample pics for some great user submitted photos including my own entries. For the price this camera will not dissapoint. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I personally don't know if there is a 5 star product anywhere, and I will save that 5th star for the day I find it.Thanks
