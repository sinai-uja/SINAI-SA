        A couple of little problems, March 6, 2006

I concur with most of the comments here.  I write only to point out a couple of things which differ in the Z740 as compared with the earlier DX6490 model.  While some consider it a good feature, it annoys me that the flash opens every time you turn the camera on, since I prefer to shoot with available light whenever possible.  Of a bit more concern, if you prefer to use the viewfinder rather than composing pictures with the rear screen, as I do, and if you prefer to use your left eye, as I do, the zoom control is too close to the viewfinder to be easily accessible.  You either have take the camera away from your eye to set the zoom, or use your right eye.  Not a deal-breaker, by any means, but, again, an annoyance.
