        A High Quality Point and Shoot Camera, June 22, 2007

I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.  I wanted a higher end "Point and Shoot" class camera.  To fit the bill, it needed to be priced appropriately, and take very good pictures that could later be enlarged and cropped with little image degradation.  This camera can do that.  Furthermore, I did not want a camera that was so manual that I would miss good shots while trying to guess which settings to use. This camera feels good in my hands (not to small and not too large) and is still light enough that you will want to take it everywhere.  Lastly, it runs on 4 AA batteries which are inexpensive easy to find.
