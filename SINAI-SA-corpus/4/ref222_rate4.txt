        easy to use digital camera, June 4, 2008
        ByMichael H. Schroeder (Grand Junction, CO)  - See all my reviews
Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomWe got this camera because our A620 failed to work right before my daughter's 5th Birthday. I opted for another Canon because we really liked the ease of use and quality of pictures from the A620. We'd used that camera almost daily with 5 y/o and 2.5y/o kids. THe A590IS works OK. The pictures are adequate, but seem to be less defined than the A620. My only other real complaint is the recharge time from picture to picture. THe A620 is faster (maybe two extra batteries helps?). The decrease in battery use (two from four) makes the A590IS lighter, but also 'feels cheaper'. We ae overall satisfied, but we went ahead and got the A620 fixed since we really like it's design and functionality.Mike
