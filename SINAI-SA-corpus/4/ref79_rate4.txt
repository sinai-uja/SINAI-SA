Got this camera for my daughter who is 11. The camera works well and is very easy to use. The lag time from going from shot to shot is a bit long 1 second or 2 but exceptable.The pictures are good and the video is better then I thought it would be. I burned a 5 minutes video to DVD and it turned out at about the quality of a standard vhs video camera from 80s or 90s in quality. I realize video has come a long way but this is not bad for a little point and shoot. So I would think this camera would be good for trips and traveling simply because it takes good pictures, takes decent, dvd burnable, video, and takes AA batteries you can buy any where any place. Also with a 8gb card we get over 2,200 pictures or over 1.5 hours of video or a combination of photo video at the cameras highest quality settings.
