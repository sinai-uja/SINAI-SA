I had the A540, I upgraded to this one. The A540 is a great camera, the A630 is the same - except it is slightly larger and has a swivel screen. The swivel screen comes in handy not only for reaching above to take a shot, but also for taking pictures and video of kids that like to watch themselves. The A630 also takes 4 AA batteries.  The video quality is great for a digital camera.  On the "standard" setting it is easy to make good movies to put on DVD.
