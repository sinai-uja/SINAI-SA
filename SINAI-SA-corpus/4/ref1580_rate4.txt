        ByB. C. S. Cassese "tarzan109" (hawaii)  - See all my reviews
i have throughly tested this camera,i brought it in to a jungle and stomped around with it for a month. took it in the ocean down to 15 ft droped it couple times but it kep on going. the pictures come ouit good and so does the video its a fast and easy camera to learn. down sides are the zoom is terrible. but they offer decent costomer support and they back up there warrentes. for 300$ its 10 megapixls and a video recorder with water capabilities. they have lots of great accessories for it to so if you wanna go deep or not have to worrie at all about ur camera then u put out 120+$ and you got a waterhousing. good buy for first timers and adventures.
