        Something *ist DL owners may want to know, January 20, 2007
        ByZhibin Yang (Ann Arbor, MI United States)  - See all my reviews
I owned a *ist DL for about 8 month and bought this upgrade. I don't have any experience with Cannon or Nikon. So my review is mostly based on a comparison to *ist DL. Hope this will help those in the same situation.I am not a Pro and will not be a Pro. So I only need a decent but inexpensive camera with a handful choice of lenses. I bought K10D mainly for (1) shake reduction (2) dust removal (3) RAW button (4) 10MB CCD. Of course, there are plenty other features to expect. At this pice level, I think K10D beats Cannon and Nikon and any others. Plus, I have had a DA 50-200mm and a couple of K and M42 Takumar manual lenses. Sticking to pentax is the best for me. After about 150 test shots, I can share you some of my opinions:Pros:-- Shake reduction is great (but it has its limit)-- dust removal comes handy-- RAW button is very useful-- manual choice of any one of 11 focus points, great for composition-- faster focus than *ist DL-- rich functions, e.g. SV mode, program line-- support ISO 100Cons:-- Weather-seal does not mean too much if you don't get weather-sealed lenses-- 10M is not much bigger than 6M (*ist DL), it is good to have but don't expect a big difference (but this is not Pentax or K10D's problem)-- Battery meter drop from full to empty without stopping at a half-empty status-- PentaPrism viewfinder is not brighter than the pentamirror of my *ist DL (at least no noticable difference)-- shutter release is not as crispy as *ist DL (just a personal feeling)It's bigger and heavier than ist DL. Great ergo design. I am happy with K10D. I take one star off for the cons listed. PS: the ccd/stablizer slides inside (even power off) when you flip the camera. a little scary when I first got it. But after some reading I think it is "normal".
