I find the camera to be of excellent quality.  It will serve my need for many years.  The only problems: Installation disc is CDI...will not run on my computer. Had to select programs from Nikon to download and don't get all the functions I want.  The memory card is old technology and the 10 megs they supply is a joke.  I've ordered a 2 gig card so I can take more than 6 pictures at once.
