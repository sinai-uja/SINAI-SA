        a bit of a disappointment, August 4, 2008
        ByMichel Le  - See all my reviews
I'm a graphic designer/art director. I published magazines and books, so photography is a key element of my work. This is my second Canon. I had a G3 that had problems with the lens (it wouldn't extend when powered on), and the screen went black after 2 years! So I got this one, because it was the only point & shoot with a swivel screen, and I wanted to give Canon another chance. I have a same comments as Flaming June. The inside shots were for most of them grainy, on various settings. Also it doesn't have shake control. Lower and cheaper models have it. I also have problems with the flash. Occasionally when I forced flash on, it wouldn't take pictures. Annoying to miss some good shots. The quality of the photos is very good for a P&S, but the top left gets way too blurry. It's fine if there is a non detailed background (ie sky) but it's a disappointment for the rest. The Canon software is good, including the stitching, but I generally end up using Photoshop.My next camera will have a swivel screen, but that won't be a Canon.Looking for THE perfect Christmas present? How about a nice warm children book to read to your kid?The Hawaii Snowman
