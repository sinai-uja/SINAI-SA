        Bigger than I expected, May 19, 2008

Camera seemed nice enough, but I was looking for something significantly smaller. I only turned it on once, but I noticed a significant delay between shots when using the flash. Not a great feature when you are trying to take pictures of kids. I returned it for the Canon SD1100is, which I love.
