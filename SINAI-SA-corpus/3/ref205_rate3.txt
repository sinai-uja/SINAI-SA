        ByCourt T. Passant (New York, NY)  - See all my reviews
This is a great camera for $100.great pics, easy to use.Only complaint, less than 30 days after I purchased it, I had to replace the date battery.Not an easy task in Buenos Aires.Why are these cameras shipping with old date batteries?
