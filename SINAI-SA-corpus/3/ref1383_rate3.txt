        3.5 stars... pros and cons, May 6, 2006
        ByJ. Woolever "her daughter" (good ol' US of A)  - See all my reviews
I've had this camera for about 6 monthes, and have recently become disapointed with the Z740's preformance. I started selling my photos in a pathetic attempt to make some much needed money, and am almost(almost being the key word)embarressed by the low quality. Pros and Cons-Pros:1)Relatively compact2)auto mode usually works pretty well3)you don't have to use flash most of the time4)you can easily review, delete, and retake a photo without missing your shot5)quick start-up6)nice album softwear7)easy to use8)Outdoor photos are very crispCons-1)Takes too long to focus, I often lose my pictures because of this (kids tend to move quite fast...)2)Indoor pictures are often blurry, or grainy3)manual controls are minimal4)LCD screen malfunctions sometimes (is this just me...?)5)lens cap WILL NOT STAY ON!6)additional lenses are limited7)I personally had to take my camera back and exchange it 3 times, once for messed up LCD, once for broken lens, and once for it being completely dead...8)The printer dock, if you get it, is a waste... goes through ink in 8 prints, leaves white spots on the pictures, and the actual photos scratch very very easilyOverall, this camera is acceptable if you're a casual photographer looking to impress your friends.... and not much more. If you're looking to become professional or at the least sell or present your photos to people, save your money and go for an SLR.
