        Still New, April 2, 2008
        ByKellyandPeanut (NC)  - See all my reviews
I've only had it 3 days but the menu is much more advanced than the 2 year old nikon coolpix and fuji I just got rid of.  So much so I'll have to read the manual, and I hate that.  But it still wont take night shots on the night setting, which after going on 2 ghost tours with the other 2 and my 12 year old canon 35 mm nothing shows up. I always had problems with night shots, batteries, and shutter speed. The reputation and charging ability was the main reason I picked this.  The choice of colors were nice, I wanted blue or gold but only Best buy and Wolf carried old boring silver or pink so I ordered from J & R online. Dont look for it at Walmart, Sears, Target, they don't have it yet.  It is the smallest digital camera I've had or seen in a long time, about the same size as my Razor cell phone.
