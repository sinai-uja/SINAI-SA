        Outdoor not indoor, July 6, 2008

I bought this camera last October.  I have been very disappointed with it.  It takes great outdoor pictures but for indoor pictures it is a crap shoot.  They might look good on the screen but once downloaded too often they are blurry or grainy.  The flash can be harsh on the eyes when used, especially with kids and in my opinion make the picture too bright.  And not using the flash the pics are worse than ever.  I am tired of getting cameras that take great outdoor pics and HORRIBLE indoor pictures.  Course I have just been sticking to Kodak easyshare cameras so might be time to change brands.
