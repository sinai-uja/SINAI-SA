i bought this camera a month before. i don't get why the picture comes so dark in the low light places. sometimes it comes completely dark in those cases. i am tired of it because i can't take any decent picture in the clubs or at night. does anyone have any suggestion about it. i played with manual but nothing seems to work. please help me if someone know about it.
