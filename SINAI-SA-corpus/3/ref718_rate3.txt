The image stabilization and the face detection work well, and most images come out wonderfully. There is a noticeable issue with noise and fast moving subjects are still an issue for me. One is common in ultra compacts and one may simply require another round with the manual so take that for what it's worth.I found the menu and settings to be usable, but the settings I want are sometimes buried on a third level. Sometimes menu response  has lagged a bit, which can be frustrating when your subject is moving faster than you are.I moved from a Canon SD20 so having an optical zoom is wonderful. Plus, this camera is not that much larger than the SD20 so I still feel like I will take it out with me without worrying about bulk. Battery life seems fine so far...much better than the SD which only holds a few minutes charge these days, despite having replaced the battery.The SD1100 seems to do a decent job overall and overcomes the photographic failures of it's operator (what do I know). If you want a simple point and shoot, you could do much worse. If you want more manual control over your pics, really good low light performance or something to document your next roller derby match, this may not be ideal.
