        Great Pics before it died, July 28, 2008

Got this camera in anticipation of lots of snorkeling in Maui, Hawaii.  Great pics above and below water for 5 of 6 days of the trip.  On the 6th day, the best snorkeling spot the camera would not work.  Water had gotten inside the camera.  So I'm conflicted in the review.  Thrilled with the pics I got, really, really upset I missed taking pics on the last day of my trip.
