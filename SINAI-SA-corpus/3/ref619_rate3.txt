        Good, but not what I expected, November 7, 2007

I bought this camera expecting great things. I do like it but there are a couple things I feel I should mention. When using the zoom, especially to get close pictures of small objects, you must hold the camera exceptionally still or the picture turns out blurred. I didn't think that would be a problem since I am used to using non digital cameras with telephoto lenses. I was wrong. Apparently this camera requires a tripod for I have yet to get a good picture when using a great deal of zoom. The other thing I felt I should mention is if you are shooting a picture through a window the color turns out faded and drab even if there is no reflection. Like I said I do like this camera, but it is not the wonder I expected.
