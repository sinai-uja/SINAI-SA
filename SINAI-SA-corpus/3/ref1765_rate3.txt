        I must have got a lemon, June 25, 2007
        ByMike Pod (Geneseo, NY)  - See all my reviews
I currently own and I am fairly happy with a Pentax Ist DS. I own several Pentax lenses. I was very dissappointed with the K10D. I got much clearer shots with my Ist DS. I tried all the tweeks I have read in several  reviews. I even shot in RAW mode and post processed in Photoshop. I hope I just got a lemon. Thank god for Amazon's return policy otherwise I would have probably been stuck with it. I am afraid I am going to bite the bullet and go with the Nikon D200.
