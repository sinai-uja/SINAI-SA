        Canon goes cheap, in a bad way., September 6, 2008

Just a note to anyone consider the A590IS camera. I bought mine and tested for 3 hours. This is to replace my older 3.2 Megapixel Canon A510 (Which is not a perfect camera, but quite a good one!)Short story: Stay away from the A590IS, it is not better than the 3 year old A510! Very disappointed at Canon for putting out this subpar product.CONS:-Pictures are soft, almost out of focus. Compared A/B with the 510 on same shots identical settings at 3 Megapixels. 510 wins hands down. -Plastic case instead of metal. Cheap and light feel. If it falls, it is toast.-Screen is larger, but also are the pixels. So, same resolution at a larger screen = very poor poor LCD image quality.-Most of the advanced features, such as focus review etc, rely heavily on the LCD, which is of poor quality, so the new features are useless!-Uninmpressed by the Image Stabilization feature. But maybe I was expecting miracles here.-No Panorama mode. (510 had a stitch mode where you could panel Left to Right and overlap the pics). I used this a lot in the old camera.-Batteries and SD card in same compartment. When I take the SD card out, the batteries tend to fall out. Its just a cumbersome process!-The so called 8 megapixels in this CCD are a bit of a joke. There wasn't a huge difference between taking a 3 megapixel pic and stretching up in Photoshop, compared to the same pic at 8 Megapixel. Very soft!
