        Product Review, June 1, 2008
        ByWilliam T. Laffond  - See all my reviews
The camera is compact, fairly light and easy to use, and takes high quality photos. I think the camera is a good value. Negatives: doesn't dock to an older Easy Share version I had; the software takes longer to start than older version; I miss having a viewfinder, this camera just has a view screen; battery cover slips open fairly easily if you hold it with a pincer grip; camera body fairly slippery, could use some coarse grip surfaces. Overall satisfied, but things I would change, and wish I had considered beforehand.
