        Actually 3 1/2 stars, June 30, 2006

We bought this camera last January for our honeymoon.  We have really put this camera to use.  Great handy little camera but with two exceptions:  (1) When taking pictures in dark places and using flash, it does not come out well.(2)  When downloading pictures to your computer, they appear 2-3 shades darker than while looking at them on camera.
