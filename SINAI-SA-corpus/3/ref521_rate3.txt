        Nice shots, BUT red eye reduction not good, January 2, 2008

I have had this camera for several months (my first digital).  Overall, the clarity and color of the shots are great.  My big complaint is that most of the time the red eye reduction doesn't work, so I waste countless hours with a photo software taking the red eye out.  The troubleshooting portion of the manual states that the subject should be looking directly at the red eye lamp.  That's not very easy when taking pictures of children.  It also recommended brighter lighting which many times a person has no control over, especially if the picture is taken outside at dusk.  I had a Ricoh film camera that I loved and the red eye reduction worked everytime.  However, that red eye reduction was a flash as bright as the flash itself (rather than a dull lamp) so I used to tell people to wait for the 2nd flash before getting out of the pose. Maybe Canon should improve the technology for its red eye reduction.
