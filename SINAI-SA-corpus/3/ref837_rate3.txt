        Good Results for Its Size, BUT..., September 6, 2008
        ByConfederate (Bethesda, MD)  - See all my reviews
This camera is unremarkable in its output, but is rich in features. It makes a good traveling camera, but if you decide on it, I'd set the image compensation to +1. Set at zero, the images tend to lack contrast and rich saturation. This is true with most cameras, both digital and print. The extra boost in exposure fills in shadow detail and boosts color saturation. Owners also should invest in a copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements, if they don't have it already. If you can cart around a slightly bigger camera, it should pay off with better quality photos; but if you want to travel light, this is as good a way as any.
