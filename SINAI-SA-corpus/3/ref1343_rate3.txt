        A Kid's Review
this camera is okay. it has reallllyyyyyy good zoom, but some of the pictures, the background is just black. and if you use the "capture subject and background" it almost always comes out blurry.  maybe mines just messed up. but yeah so hopefully im getting a new camera. but still keeping this one for traveling and stuff. because the landscape feature is excellent. i wouldnt suggest this camera for every day use. but its pretty good.          BREAKS EASILY IF DROPPED.   dropped mine the first day i got it. it broke, but i was sent a new one for free. i've used the neckstrap ever since.
