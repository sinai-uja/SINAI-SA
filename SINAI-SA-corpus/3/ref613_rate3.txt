        Indoor shots are so grainny, April 7, 2007
        ByLarry Vu  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera A630 to upgrade from my old A95 camera.  Sport shooting mode is not availble with the new A630 camera unlike the A95.  I'm so disappointed with the indoor shots so grainny and poor in details and clarity.  New camera suppose to be better than the older ones but unfortunately this is not the case.  If you plan to take a lot of indoor shots then you should not buy this camera A630.
