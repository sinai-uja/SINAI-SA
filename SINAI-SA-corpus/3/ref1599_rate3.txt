I like this camera for a 'FUN CAMERA'.  The zoom isn't very good at all.  The audio is horrible.  But I do like how long the video clips can be and I LOVE the waterproof and shockproof feature.  I bought the 'silicone skin' for a cover and it's basically my 5 year old boys camera.  He enjoys playing with it and I have no worries.
