        You'll want to order an upgraded memory card, December 7, 2007

It wasn't clear to me from the product description how inadequate the memory card included with the camera would be.  It came with a 16M card that was full after I shot a half-dozen still images.  You'll want to order an upgraded card (I went with a 1G SanDisk card) at the same time that you order the camera, otherwise you won't be able to do much with it.  Otherwise I've been pretty happy with the camera, although I'm still playing around with different settings, lighting, etc.
