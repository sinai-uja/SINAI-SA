        Wanted to like it but one main problem, June 13, 2008
        ByMike D. from Waukesha (Waukesha, WI USA)  - See all my reviews
Really wanted to like this camera.  Read a ton beforehand and it had mostly superlative reviews.  I did like most everything about it except picture IQ-the most important feature in a camera.Severe underexposure in all modes.
