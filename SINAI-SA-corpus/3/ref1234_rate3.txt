        third times the charm??, October 30, 2008
        ByKelcey_Bea  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera while i was pregnant because i figured i would need a good one for when the baby came. I was really pleased with it and it did take really nice photos. The videos werent the best but i suppose you cant expect perfect videos from a cheap camera. When the baby came i had someone running around the delivery room snapping pictures. Every other picture was blurry. I dont know if it was the operator or just the camera. I did notice that you had to wait a long time and have the perfect light for the camera to take really good pics. After having the camera for about 2 or 3 months i had an accident involving dirty baby clothes a misplaced camera and a washing machine...needles to say the camera didnt make it out alive. I decided to go ahead and buy the same camera agian. I was still pleased with it but a little bummed i couldnt find the 10mp for as cheap so instead i had to settle for the 8.2. Anyways im an avid review reader and i had read a couple that said the camera straight up quit working after 6 months. I decided to ignore them because most of the other comments were totally positive. I had my second camera for about 5 months and it died...on its own...no washing machine involved. It was like the Auto Focus just completely quit working for some reason. (really bad timing too because i was at the hospital with my friend while she was having HER baby when i found out it quit working.) Anyway i liked the camera but cant decide if i want to try it out a third time and risk the chance of getting burned.
