        Almost but not quite. . ., September 4, 2004

I liked a lot of things about this camera--it was easy to figure out--a real plus for a relative novice--, it had good response time on the shutter, quality of pictures was good, and I was able to adjust it for a variety of conditions.  However, it did have a tendency to overexpose shots, especially in full sun outdoors, or when using the flash indoors.  Now, this can be adjusted for--you can go into the "exposure" option on the menu and take down the exposure a bit, and that worked well.  I even found that if I underexposed pictures a bit, and then brightened them up when I got them on my computer, I often got better color and detail than the default exposure settings.  So I almost kept it.  But the fatal flaw for me was that, having taken the trouble to get all the menu settings where I wanted them--if I changed the dial setting, or shut the camera off, they were gone.  The settings all reverted automatically to the default, so I'd have to do it all over again ten minutes later to get the next shot.  It was a near thing--but I returned the camera.  However, for anyone who isn't quite the control freak I am, this is a good camera at a good price.  I was worried about battery life, but I took well over 100 shots before the digital AA batteries that came with it wore out.  I tossed in a pair of rechargeable AAs, and took maybe 150 more, and they hadn't run down when I decided to return it.  Of course, I don't use the LCD as my viewfinder, which helps extend battery life a lot.  On the other hand, I did spend quite a lot of time reviewing pictures on the LCD, and even took some videos just for fun, so considering how Consumer Reports rated Kodak cameras on battery relative to other digital cameras, I was quite pleased.
