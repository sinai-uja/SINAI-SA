        Good Camera - Lousy Software, December 21, 2008

Perfect little camera for the money. Good pics except for low light group shots. The flash isn't designed for that, just closer up shots. My wife uses for real estate and likes it. Video is not bad either with a large SD card. Don't even think about installing the software!! It installed on one computer but failed on the other half way through. I could not remove it and the Canon WEB site is no help at all. You can use the Microsoft downloader just fine to download pics and video. Again, don't install the software!!
