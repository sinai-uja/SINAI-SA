This camera is for absolute beginners and people who want complete ease of use with no special preferences. If you do anything with graphic design, stay away from this camera! Their software is invasive and does not cooperate. I had to download patch and still it did not work. Kodak customer service is one of the worst. For this reason I would not recommend this camera. Camera shoots good pictures, no problem there. Of course any big zoom takes a lot of battery power. Lithium charger cost more money. I think it is better to spend a little more and get Canon with 10X zoom. I would not go with Sony, because their larger screens take more power and it is all about power conservation with digital cs.
