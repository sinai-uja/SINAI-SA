        ByDecaf Photo (Seattle, WA)  - See all my reviews
I purchased this camera before I became a professional photographer, and for someone who is 1, inexperienced and 2, on a budget, it works good.  Not great, good.  First of all, I live in Washington.  I bought the camera during the summer and I took all these beautiful shots because there was great sunlight.  However once the overcast fall and winter started setting in I realized a major drawback, in low light the quality of photos drops off dramatically.  Also, it's somewhat brittle.  It took an approximately one foot drop when I was in tacoma and the LCD broke, manual settings no longer functioned and I've had a lot of trouble with the lens.So in conclusion, if you are an inexperienced photographer, this is easy enough for you to pick up and take some pretty good pictures.  If you live in a cloudy area, you'll have to use flash and it doesn't pick up skin tones well at all when you use it.   I also wouldn't recommend it for a kid because one drop and look what happens.  It has the basic manual settings if you're a slightly more advanced user, but with so many auto only settings if you know what you're doing at all, you'll probably be frustrated.  You get what you pay for.
