        Over-rated Canon SD1100IS, May 15, 2008
        ByE. Epstein (Ft  Lauderdale)  - See all my reviews
Just bought the SD1100IS to replace a 1-1/2 year old Casio Exilim EX-Z850 that I broke. I checked out all of the reviews for this new Canon model and was impressed with the comments. But after receiving the camera and using it for a few weeks I am beginning to have my doubts. In fact, right now I would happily give it back to have my Casio Exilim back!1. Slow, slow, slow - the setup time for every shot, particularly indoor shots, is really annoying. My Casio was ready in about half the time.2. Grainy images on screen for any nightime indoor shots.3. Severely under-powered flash - I thought I read some reviews that gave it an OK rating at 10 feet...try about 8 feet and you might be more accurate. Many flash shots were severely darkened by lack of light...and often the flash only covered a portion of the image leaving faces dark and everything else in the photo bright.4. Used it last weekend for a wedding - roughly half of the shots had to be thrown away...you don't get a lot of opportunities at a wedding. Things move along at their own pace. So walking down the aisle, every other shot was blurry, or out of focus. 5. Face Recognition software worked sometimes, and other times drove me crazy as it would not lock in anywhere near the faces....I eventually shut it off.6. The pictures - well yes it does take nice pictures...if you're willing to put up with a very annoying camera. Maybe I'll get more used to it over time. I just can't afford to have so many bad shots among the good ones.
