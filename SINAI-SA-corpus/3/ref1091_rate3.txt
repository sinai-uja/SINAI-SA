I just got this camera today, and although I kinda like it, I am really disappointed at some of the picture quality. Keep in mind, though, that I was taking the pictures of myself so my hand was a little shaky. Also, when i tried to use the color swap it didn't work all that great and was confusing...there is a better canon camera for only about $50 more that I wish I had gotten. My older sister got it instead...
