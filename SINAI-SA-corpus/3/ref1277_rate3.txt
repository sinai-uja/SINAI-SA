        Not Too Impressed - but worth $100.00, June 6, 2008
        ByFrank M. (Los Angeles, CA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera on sale at Target for $100 and glad I did! This camera is basic, works fine, takes good pictures, and thats about it. I would compare the quality of picture to more of an 7megapixel, not 10. I've taken better looking pictures with an 8megapixel Olympus ($150) camera. The video is bad. Very low resolution that cant be raised and there is purple tint and vertical lines while recording. I'd recommend this camera for the low price of $100 or less, and to first time buyers. But if you got the money, definitely spring for a better camera with more features. Canon camera's seem to be what everyone recommends. Casio has great features.
