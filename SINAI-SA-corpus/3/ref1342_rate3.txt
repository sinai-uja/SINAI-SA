        Still a work in progress, August 7, 2006
        ByTimothy J. Phillips (Lombard, IL USA)  - See all my reviews
So far, I am very happy with the quality of the photos, but I haven't really had much of a chance to use the zoom. I'm still trying to get used to all of the different settings. One thing drives me crazy and that's the lens cap! It will not stay on, no matter what I have tried. But I can't say I wasn't warned, one of the othere reviewers had the same problem.
