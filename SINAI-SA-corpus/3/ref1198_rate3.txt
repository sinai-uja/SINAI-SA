        Lots of MP for cheaper, you get what you pay for., February 10, 2008

I'm torn about this camera.On the one hand, it has really nice picture quality: really brilliant colors with enough light and lots of MPs for the price. Then again pictures tend to run a bit blurry at times and the response time button-to-capture lags a bit.Overall I'm really happy with the pictures. This camera is a nice fit for what I need: I don't take photos often, and when I do I like doing artsy quiet shots. If you're more on-the-go and need higher performance, go with a CANON.AUDIO CLICKING ON VIDEO FEATURE: Videos will have a clicking noise in the audio. It wasn't until I read another Amazon review that I discovered this happens because of the Auto Focus feature. Thankfully it's stopped since I've turned the feature off. Absolutely annoying design flaw.
