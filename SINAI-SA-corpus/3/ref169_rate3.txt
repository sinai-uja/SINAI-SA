        Canon 590, January 7, 2009
        ByF. Lopez (Chatsworth, CA)  - See all my reviews
If I had known it takes so long for the camera to be ready for the next picture, I would have bought something else.  If you want a camera that takes a picture when you press the button, buy a different camera.  Or, if you want a camera that can take multiple pictures quickly, buy a different camera.  This is a great camera for taking group pictures, outdoor pictures or things that don't move.  Don't buy it to take action shots.  You'll miss every one of them.
