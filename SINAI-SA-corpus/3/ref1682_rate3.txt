        1030 SW great idea, failed after a week of heavy use, January 20, 2009

I used my 1030 SW as backup for a digital SLR during a once in a lifetime cruise through the Galapagos. Picture quality good for P after 4 one hour trips in the water, the camera failed.  It turned on and off, but would not take pictures and the LCD screen did not work.  I am sending it back for replacement.  Its a great idea for a go anywhere do anything camera, but it did not stand up to what I consider minor water exposure.  Others have had better experience, but I had not warning of potential crash.
