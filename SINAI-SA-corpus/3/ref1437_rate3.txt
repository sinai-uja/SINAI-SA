        AutoFocus and Color-Quality Not What I Had Hoped For..., September 17, 2007
        ByPiXiEmOm  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera expecting quality photos. That "color science chip" logo seemed so promising. Unfortunately, the colors are not as vibrant as I had expected. Most of the time, images seem washed out. Of course, you can go through the menu and select "vivid color", but it's time-consuming, AND you have to do that EVERY time you turn the camera on. What a pain! The white balance on this camera is also disappointing.The auto-focus was the most disappointing feature of this camera. It has significant difficulties focusing in low light, but also picks the most inconvenient times to have difficulty focusing during the day as well. If you're planning on taking pictures indoors under incandescent lights, you might as well find a different camera, because this one refuses to focus. The flash also washes people out unless you're standing about 8 feet away from them.  I really expected a lot more from Kodak....looks like I'll be buying another Canon next time! : 0P
