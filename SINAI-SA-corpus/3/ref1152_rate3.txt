        Great speed, poor picture quality, September 5, 2005

I bought this camera while on vacation to replace my 3.2 megapixel Canon PowerShot A70.  Since then I've taken a few hundred pictures and just don't like the picture quality as much as the camera it replaced.  The pixel count is higher but the overall image quality seems worse.  The auto focus almost always tends to blur just a little, even when the camera is balanced on a stable surface.  I just finished editing pictures I took in Paris and became more and more disappointed at the quality the more I examined the photos for focus and contrast.The one pro I've identified is that the Kodak does take pictures quickly and doesn't have the annoying lag that plagued my Canon.If you are buying this to replace a Canon make sure you're satisfied with the image quality differences before purchasing.
