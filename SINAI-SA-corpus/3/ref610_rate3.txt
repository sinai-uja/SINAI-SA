The quality of this product is far inferior to the A95 that I bought about two years ago, so the "upgrade" (in terms of pixels, zoom, and LCD screen size) was a mistake. In particular, the LCD screen does not seem to work consistently and the automatic interchange between portrait and landscape format on screen is annoying.
