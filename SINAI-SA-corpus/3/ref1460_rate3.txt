        Complicated camera, lacks some basic features, May 30, 2004
        By A Customer
I purchased this camera when it first came out based on the rave reviews of the photo quality.  Indeed, it takes great photos.  However, there are some basic design flaws and ommisions that I felt were critical enough to get rid of it and replace it with a different camera.  The location of some the buttons is just wrong.  It is easy to inadvertently change a setting just by trying to hold the camera.The setup and menus are VERY complicated...much more confusing that any of the 5 other digicams I've owned.  It also doesn't alow you to rotate the photos for correct display on a TV set....even my $300 Canon does that....and the Canon automatically displays each photo correctly.   The most significant ommision, however, is the lack of a focus assist-lamp for low-light conditions.  Since it's virtually impossible to manually focus a digital camera, you need a reliable auto-focus.  We found that even in modest low-light settings we couldn't get it to focus.  My wife was so frustrated with it that she wouldn't even use it.  We replaced it with a Canon which we are very happy with.
