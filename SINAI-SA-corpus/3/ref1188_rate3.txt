        understand flash, June 4, 2004

At least one of the problems described by the commentator above may be due to user error.  I am regularly amazed by people who try to use a flash to capture people on stage 50 feet away (or even use flash to attempt to take a picture of a projected film on a screen).  The tiny flashes on ALL portable cameras only work up to about 15 feet away (and if they are close enough to a film screen they'll just wipe it out with white light).So, we shouldn't be surprised that your flash pictures of your cousin turned out dark -- the flash didn't reach him.  And, we shouldn't be surrpised that it was blurry -- when zoomed in, in low light, any autofocus will have trouble tracking and the CCD will barely get enough light to register anything.(I don't have this particular camera so just gave it a middling rating out of ignorance.)
