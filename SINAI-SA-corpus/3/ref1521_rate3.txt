        Save your money-buy the real thing, April 25, 2005

If you are looking for an entry level professional camera, save up and buy an SLR. I have had this camera for a little over a month and am ready to throw it out the window.  AUTO FOCUS PROBLEMSThe thing can't take a picture that's in focus.  At one to one, out of the 958 pictures I've taken, none of them are sharp.  It simply can't do it.  Many subjects it can't focus at all.  Its impossible to judge from the tiny monitor the true sharpness of the photo. Its not uncommon to review a batch of photos on the computer and find that half of them are completely fuzzy.  The auto focus is also extremely slow.  It can take several seconds for the camera find its mark.MANUAL FOCUS IS A JOKEThe manual focus is awkward to use.  Although, that's prety much irellevant because the camera's monitor does not have enough resolution to use it.  Its been suggested to me that I try bracketing the focus.  Except, the point of bracketing is not to be aimlessly wasting memory, hoping that one of the shots is good.TIGHTEST APERATURE IS 8.7I thought I could deal with this because most of the work I do is in moderate to low light.  That was a mistake.  This compounds the previously mentioned Auto Focus issues.HIGH RESOLUTIONThe difference from a 35mm film scan is astounding.  Its amazing to pull up a 6X9 at 300 ppi with no noise or grain.  EASY TO USEThe camera is set up like the 35mm SLR I've used for years to and have found it easy to navigate.  The buttons on the side can be touched accidentally causing some minor annoyance.CONCLUSIONIf you are a casual user, this camera may be just fine for you.  The focusing issues become pronounced when you are trying to achieve a specific aestetic.  Perfect focus may not be that important to you eighter, especially if you print mostly to 4x6 or 5x7.  Looking at  the other ratings, many people love this camera.  However, the serious amateur or entry level proffesional should not waste their time and money on this camera.
