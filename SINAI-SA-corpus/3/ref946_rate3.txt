        good camera with short battery life, July 15, 2008
        Bydumb scientist "Yan" (Chicago, IL USA)  - See all my reviews
The camera is great, the small size makes it easy to carry it around. Pictures are of good quality. The indoor shooting is too good to compare with my old Sony. My only problem is the battery life is too short. Hope it's just mine. It barely worked for me for a 2-day trip, and we didn't use the flash light a lot. I consider that unacceptable.
