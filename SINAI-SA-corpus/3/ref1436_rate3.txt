        When it's good, it's really good..., January 21, 2008
        Bybuddyhead (Taxachusetts)  - See all my reviews
... and when it's bad, it's awful.  A couple of the other reviews for this product hit the camera's cons on the head.  In order of annoyance (1 being most annoying):  (1)  The focus is lousy.  It's horrendous in low light, and just plain bad in perfectly bright light.  I've found this camera has a real tendency to focus very precisely on background objects, even when you take care to make sure the green focus brackets are positioned correctly.  (2)  The flash is weak in low light... except for when it is way too powerful.  I have a ton of photos where subjects' faces are awash in bright white light.  There is no controlling this, and in fact, I have taken the same shot several times in a row and experienced varying intensities of flash despite not doing anything differently.  And beware that the LCD screen will often make outdoor photos look darker than they really are (which causes you to use the flash for the next shot, which causes overexposed photos, which causes you to disable the flash... repeat, repeat, repeat).  (3)  The lens cap is so awful it positively leaps off the camera.  The attachment point for the lens strap busted, too, so the lens cap falls to the ground now.  I swear, if you look at this camera the wrong way, the lens cap falls off.   A solution is to shoot tons of pictures for any given scene or subject, plan on chucking about 1/2 of them due to flash or focus, and you'll be fine.  The ones that eventually achieve the right balances can be excellent, but, boy, is it a labor to get to them.
