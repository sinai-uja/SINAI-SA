        Defect in the Olympus Stylus 1030sw, August 27, 2008
        ByG. Appell  - See all my reviews
The Olympus Stylus 1030SW has been shipping with a known defect by Olympus.  In the video recording mode the sound track contains a popping sound.  It is generated by any touching of the camera.  Olympus is supposedly coming out with a firmware fix in September.  The buyer should beware of this problem and perhaps wait to purchase until a fix is incorporated in the cameras.
