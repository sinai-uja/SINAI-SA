        Pictures too dark, December 1, 2007
        ByKimberly Howells  - See all my reviews
I bought the Kodak V1003 in late August 2007 at Target...I find I am constantly using the PERFECT TOUCH technology feature  in the camera  to brighten up the picture...  I primarily take pictures of people....I personally like brighter pictures than this camera takes...Although I love all the user- friendly features  and  durability  (dropped it on hard concrete...no damage!)  of this Kodak camera ...I decided to buy         the Canon Powershot SD 750 Elph camera last week from amazon and so far I am much   happier with the brightness of this Canon camera's    pictures!
