        small annoyances, June 18, 2007
        ByD. Berube "water lover" (Taunton, MA)  - See all my reviews
I have been happy with the quality of the pictures which has been very rewarding. I do have a couple of compaints though that I find worth sharing with others interested in this camera. The reviews I read before my purchase stated how the pop the lense cap popping off every time you turn the camera on is quite annoying which I found to be the case. There's no option to just look at your photos without the lense pushing out and the cap popping off. I have found that a camera that has an automatic lense like that uses up the battery pretty quickly. I find I need to replace the battery every 3 months with just general use of the camera. If purchasing this camera, buy the recharger along with it and a case as well. Also, the camera is very awkward to carry around to events without a case.
