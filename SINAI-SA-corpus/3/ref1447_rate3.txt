        Auto focus problems, September 21, 2002
        By A Customer
This is my first digital camera. The sharpness of the images and the ability to manipulate images in the computer are astounding. I cropped out about one third of an image, saved it on a CD, then took it to a Kinko's and printed it on a Kodak machine. I blew it up to an 8x10. I swear, you'd think it was taken in a studio with a Hasselblad. Sending jpegs over email is so fast and easy a child could do it.Here's my beef: I can't get the auto focus to work ... in low light. By low light, I mean ambient light indoors at night; say for example, taking snapshots at your kid's birthday party. It doesn't seem to matter what auto focus settings I use. This problem comes close to ruining the camera for me. Now, as I said, this is my first digital camera, so I have nothing to compare it to. I don't know if the Coolpix is better/worse/the same as other digital cameras. I am told that auto focus in low light is an issue for all digital cameras. Anyhow, be alert to that problem, try to research it, and ask yourself, if you can't take snapshots of your kid's birthday party, what good is it?
