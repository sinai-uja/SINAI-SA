        Waterlogged Easily, June 9, 2008
        ByBret Schumacher (Kauai, Hawaii)  - See all my reviews
Purchased this camera and within a month of snorkeling on weekends (live in Hawaii) the camera was full of water without going deeper than maybe 5ft.  The product was purchased directly through amazon.com versus through one of the other vendors available through amazon.com so the return policy was easy & uncomplicated - they even paid for the return shipping costs & made a full refund.  My next camera purchase is the same model through amazon.com as well (return process was so easy always check vendor if possible) as the picture clarity is great, camera is so simple and easy to use, and is compact enough you can swim without it being too bulky or heavy.  New order should arrive this week - check to see in a month if the last one was just a fluk defect or if this camera is flawed as a quasi-underwater camera for novice photographers.  I look forward to purchasing the underwater housing...then it can come along on scuba days too!
