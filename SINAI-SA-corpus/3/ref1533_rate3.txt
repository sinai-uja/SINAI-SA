        Slow/confused auto focus, August 3, 2003
        By A Customer
I have always used Nikon 35mm SLR Cameras for my photography hobby and decided to go for a digital and bought coolpix 5700. The camera takes great pictures, but too slow in focusing. it's got lot of features but takes too many buttons to set. while you are trying set up your camera you'll miss your shots.  I been taking it mostly in manual mode because, I have hard time getting the correct exposure from program mode, so I use manual, shutter/apature priority. My recommandation is if you are taking moving objects, the camera is way too slow (typical digital camera is slow but I find that it's slower than avg), but if you are taking non moving object such as landscape, it takes excellent pictures.  my biggest frustration of using this camera is that it's way toooooooo slow. If I get the correct setting for picture in time, the picture quality is excellent, but main problems is setting the camera up correctly ( or I could in my learning curve).
