I've had my CX7430 for over 2 years now and have enjoyed this camera thoroughly. The camera has great zoom capabilities and can get you close to the subject you want to photograph. The battery life is very decent, even when the LCD display is being used. The pictures themselves (when left on Auto mode) are super - the colors and clarity are excellent. I've received very positive feedback about the clarity of the pictures. The memory cards are inexpensive too, especially if you don't buy the Kodak brand of SD cards. The camera is preloaded for only 10 pictures and comes with a nonrechargable battery set, so investing in memory and batteries is a must. My favorite feature is the video capabilities; with my 1GB card (and the camera will accept up to a 2GB card) I can get close to 70 minutes of video, with wonderful audio. The video is recorded in .mov files and are quite impressive. The downsides? Sure, there are a few..  the camera is quite bulky in comparison to almost all other digi cams currently available - it's quite `fat' in size, and the casing is very easily scratched, even with gentle use and care; and night shots taken outside (like fireworks or holiday lights) are pretty terrible - blurry and unusable. Overall I am very impressed with the quality and features of this camera and won't be replacing it for quite some time. The 4MP are more than enough for quality photos, the video is a wonderful bonus and the ease of use is wonderful. Highly recommended.
