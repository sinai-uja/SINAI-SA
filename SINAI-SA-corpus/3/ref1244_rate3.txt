        ByTinkerbell  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera because I thought it's a great value. I paid $170 a year ago, hard to beat the price considering this is a 10 mp camera.I've given it 3 starts because I do like the quality of the pictures. It's sharp enough for me, I'm not a professional photographer or anything, but I've been taking daily pictures of my baby since she was born and the results have been pretty good with this camera.As far as recording videos,......This camera is terrible. The quality is awful, very grainy and once you transfer the videos to your computer, it's almost impossible to hear the sound. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong - like another reviewer said, the manual is no help whatsoever, you have to figure it all out by trail and error .My brother has recently bought the exact same camera, but 8 mp instead of 10, and much to my surprise his videos have a much better quality than mine. I can't figure out why.
