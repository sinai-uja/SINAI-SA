        Waterproof vs. Image Quality, May 15, 2008
        Bym. fung (new york, ny usa)  - See all my reviews
Purchased Olympus 1030SW mainly for waterproof/freezer/drop features. My vacations are watersports and wintersports. So now I don't have to worry about climate and environment factors effecting my pictures or making sure the camera is inside a ziploc bag.BUT ... the image quality is sacrificed. My old Canon S400 4MP camera image quality is better, I mean way better. Sharper + better color. Even the Canon flash pictures don't look so "white". Since I don't print anything bigger than 5x7, I can live with it for now.
