        Nice camera, but delays, January 29, 2007

It's a good camera, but getting used to the delay (vs. a traditional 35 mm SLR) is still bugging me a month into owning it. I'm sure I can mess with the settings somehow to shorten that, but so far I haven't figured it out. I also get red-eye in my subjects even with red-eye reduction on, unless they look directly into the lens. Both of these things take away some of the spontaneity in picture taking. I would have liked a wider lens and image stabilization, and looked at the Canon SD800, but it wasn't available on amazon when I ordered this one. But since I love the A630's grip and feel (especially the knob at the top with very facile thumb-friendly mode dial), what I lost in wide angle to "hand happiness" is really a toss-up, and I was a little afraid I'd drop the smaller SD800. The LCD & control interfaces are okay, but I wish more of the modes and icons were more intuitive. The screen is bright and clear, especially appreciated when zooming in on playback. Downloading to a Mac is easy as pie and I like Canon's ImageBrowser that came with the A630 much better than iPhoto.
