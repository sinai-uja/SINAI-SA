I had this camera for several months, and the results are mixed.  Sometimes I am very pleased with the photos, but other times they come out very blury, especially under low lighting.  Sure, a tripod helps and many of the manual controls help, but I am mostly interested in taking pics of my kids, which requires a camera to snap descent pics w/o all the hassle.  In the end I decided on a higher-end camera with optical stabilization --- Canon S3 and have been very satisfied with it.  All the research in the world can still lead you to the wrong camera... in the end what matters is a retailer with a generous return policy.
