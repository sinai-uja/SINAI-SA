        This camera will not run with rechargable batteries!, February 7, 2007

I just bought this camera and was extremely dissappointed to find out that it will only run using alkaline batteries.   Fully charged NIMH batteries will cause it to start extending the lens and then shut down with it half way out.  This is completely unacceptable.   Because of its high 'dead' battery voltage, you aren't able to fully use alkalines either.   They are still quite useable in other things when this camera says they are dead.  Besides this problem though, this camera has a lot of nice features.   I am happy with everything else.  Just the same, I wouldn't have bought this camera if I had realized how bad its power problems are.
