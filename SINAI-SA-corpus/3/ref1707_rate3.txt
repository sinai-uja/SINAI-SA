        The ideal knockabout travelling camera, except for two problems., February 7, 2009

I purchased this to be the camera I could finally just stick in my pocket or pack and be gone.  No other has been able to take the abuse.  And it's very, very good, including features and optional on-camera guides to effects.The problems have to do with use as a travelling camera.  One cannot download pictures without their special computer to camera cord.  Looks like a mini-USB, isn't, and you can't take pictures and process on a friends laptop without dragging that around also.  When one is travelling light carrying the cord is a nuisance.  It's in the way and weighs.An out would have been having an SD card instead of their proprietary memory card.  Their card cannot be read by anything found in the course of normal human events.  Bluetooth would have been nice.Great item as long as one wants it only for short jaunts and doesn't plan on processing any photos without dragging along that proprietary cord.  Or a reader of some type for their memory card.
