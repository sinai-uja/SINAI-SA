        there's one con that really makes me unhappy, November 25, 2005
        ByN. Broodie  - See all my reviews
the one thing i really do not like is that you cannot zoom while filming video.  this makes no sense to me as i would want to focus in on different things while filming.  i understand that i'm buying it more for pictures but at 300 dollars i would at least expect to take video clips on trips.  updated 11-30-05i replaced the camera with a canon S2 powershot and i would definitely recommend the canon over the kodak.  the S2 has 12x optical zoom, 5MP, and takes beautiful video that allows you to zoom.  the few indoor pictures i took with the kodak do not compare with canon's indoor shots.  canon's shots look much cleaner, brighter, and sharper than my kodak shots (in the same room with the same lighting).  the S2 is a more expensive but canon also sells an S1 which also has very good reviews on amazon.  i recommend checking it out.
