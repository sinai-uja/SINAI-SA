        Great camera except for flash problems, July 27, 2008

We have owned this camera for just under two years.  It has lots of powerful features that we've enjoyed using, especially things like timed exposures.  We have taken a lot of great pictures with it.  However, recently the flash has intermittently stopped working.  When trying to take a picture, the symbol for the flash would blink on and off on the screen, and it refused to take the picture unless we turned the flash off.  The manual says nothing about what the blinking flash symbol means.  At present, the flash works sometimes, but it is no longer synchronized with the shutter.  Is this an electronic problem rather than a mechanical problem?  Anyway, it sets the shutter speed, etc., based on the presence of the flash, but the flash is early - "flash . . click".  So no pictures come out right.  Time to get another camera.
