        a bit hit and miss, really., December 6, 2008
        ByCarly Campbell (Ludington, Michigan, USA)  - See all my reviews
I did a bit of research on this camera before making the decision to buy it. Apparently I just didn't do enough.At 10mp, the quality is disappointing. I've had cameras that were perhaps 4mp and yet they still took sharper, clearer photos. As much as I play with the settings, and no matter how steady the photo is or how careful I am in paying attention to the lighting, I still find it falling behind my first Kodak from 1998. This is not a good thing, in the least.It is also very fragile! I had to send in my first one for a broken lens when it slipped out of my hand and hit the table, even though I had the wrist strap on and the fall was perhaps a few inches.On the bright side, it is extremely easy to navigate, and focuses very well, even if the quality isn't as wonderful as I had been hoping. All in all, it is a fairly good camera for its price, and beats out most other digitals in its price range. However, I think I'll do a bit more review reading the next time I buy a camera -- and probably go crawling back to Nikon for the quality/durability combo I desire.
