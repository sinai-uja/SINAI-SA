        Bad decision, January 3, 2006
        ByShutter Bug "SB" (Kansas City, MO USA)  - See all my reviews
I have had numerous digital cameras.  I almost always go for a Canon, but Canon stopped making it's 5mp with 10x zoom.  I read about the Kodak Z740 online and decided to buy it.  I bought it on sale for $299 at OfficeMax.  It was the worst decision I have ever made.  It can not even come close to my Canon that only has 4mp and 5x zoom.  Using zoom, you can not even tell what the picture is.  The flash is HORRIBLE.  Any photos I took with the flash turned out a blue color.  The only decent photos shot with this camera were outside in bright sunlight with the flash off.  Do not even try to look at the sample photos from users for this camera.  There is NO WAY any of those are possible with the camera I bought.  I will never buy another Kodak.The people at OfficeMax were very nice about it, though.
