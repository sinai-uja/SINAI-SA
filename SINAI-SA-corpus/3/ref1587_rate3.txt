        Wasn't quite a good as I would have hoped, September 17, 2008
        ByR. Cathcart (Louisville, Ky)  - See all my reviews
I dropped my Canon 800si camera and the shutter quit working.  Since it was over the warranty period, I bought this camera as a replacement since it looked so cool.  I found it not to be as good as my Canon for zooming and picture quality even though my Canon was a 7.1 megapixel and this one is a 10 megapixel. I should have bought another Canon 800si.
