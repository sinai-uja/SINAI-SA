I have been very pleased with the pictures I've taken with this camera as far as outdoor still-life (flowers, ...). However, in low-light, it is very difficult to get a good shot. With flash, the color is off, with no flash, it is extremely blurry every time. But, takes pretty decent video and seems to hold battery charge pretty well.
