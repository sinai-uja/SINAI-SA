        What is wrong with movies?, January 20, 2007
        ByR. Lefever  - See all my reviews
Has anyone else had this problem?.....I have an A620 and just got the A630.  When taking movies with the new A630, there are a lot more rolling lines and "screen" effect than is with the A620, especially in the edges of objects.This is in the 640 x 480 mode at 30 fps. (most popular shooting mode)The movie quality should be at least as good in the A630 as it was in the A620, rather than objects looking like they are moving around and "rolling" the peppermint twist. Otherwise, I would have given this camera 5 stars. This is a lot less of a problem in my A620.
