I recently purchased this camera for my wife who uses it for her work at the quilt guild. The image projected on the screen, on the back, is of very poor quality vs the last Cannon. You sometimes will see what looks like a faint green fuzzy line running from top to bottom on the screen. We also feel that the picture quality of the shots are not as sharp and clear as the last Cannon we purchased. I'll try another brand when this one quits working. It was a lot cheaper than the last Cannon we purchased in 2004, but most electronic digital cameras have dropped in price. Would choose a different camera if I had to make the choice again.
