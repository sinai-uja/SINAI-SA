        Good camera, bad support, May 8, 2005
        ByJohn J Ewan (Missoula, MT USA)  - See all my reviews
As cameras go, this one is easy to use and takes great pictures.  It has some really nice features too.  But digital cameras are more than just stand-alone devices; you have to connect them to something else to get the pictures off.  That's where I ran into trouble.  It seems the "Easyshare" software on the CD with the camera is incompatible with Windows 2000 or XP if they are fully updated.  They suggest that you download new software from their website instead, but to do that you must register, and their website refused to let me do that.  So to share pictures on a camera with "EasyShare" in its NAME, I had to eventually go to Microsoft's support site to learn how to uninstall the Windows update that was interfering with Kodak's software.  Now I have to worry about Windows re-installing that update next time I run Windows Update.  Does this seem "Easy" to you?In short, do not buy this camera unless you have good computer skills and time to spend.  Shame on Kodak for so blatantly dropping the ball.
