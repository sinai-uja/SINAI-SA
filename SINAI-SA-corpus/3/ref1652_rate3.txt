        Rugged and waterproof, but takes lousy pictures, May 27, 2008
        ByMichael Trotman (Daniel Island, SC USA)  - See all my reviews
Olympus Stylus 1030SW 10.1MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Optical Wide Angle Zoom (Silver)This is a nice camera if you're looking primarily for a camera that is small, rugged, and waterproof.  However, if you're looking for a camera that takes great pictures - keep looking.  The image quality is terrible so forget the 10.1 mega pixel feature.  And since the 3.6 optical zoom is hardly enough to zoom in on far away objects the poor image quality becomes a big deal.  When you crop a photo in an attempt to "zoom" digitally, you can see terrible pixilation, grain, and blur.  I considered sending the camera back to Amazon, but decided to keep it for taking photos in the water.  If I didn't want that feature I would have definitely returned it for something else.
