I bought this camera for it's price.  I wanted something that took a good photo and if I needed to replace it (or I lost it), it wouldn't be a total loss.  The camera's pictures are pretty good, however, it's response is very, very slow.  To boot up the camera, focus on a subject, and shoot a picture takes up to 20 seconds.  Pressing the shoot button often results in a 1+ second response.  If you are not perfectly focused on the subject(s) (i.e. when taking a picture of 2 people, if the center focus comes to rest between the subjects) the foreground comes out blurry.Overall, it's a good camera for someone who has never had a digital camera before.  I'm going back to the Powershot/Elph series.
