        SLOW FOCUS! Good pics when you don't miss them!, January 4, 2004
        By A Customer
My father raved about this camera. So, when he died and left me some money, I bought the camera. Now I wish I hadn't! I had a $200 Kodak digital with nearly no megapixels, and it took awesome pictures, quickly, and even in low light. But, I could not blow them up very big. The Nikon 5700 takes HUGE pictures, but I rarely get good ones, because the focus is so slow that my subject has left the building before the darned camera focuses! It can't focus in low light situations at all, and beware buying kits, because most of the stuff that came in my "Kit" doesn't fit the stupid camera! Plan to buy at least four batteries in all (and an extra charger), because you need to have two batteries charging and two batteries with you at all times. This thing doesn't just eat batteries, it chews them up and spits them out! The ttl viewfinder is digital too, so very hard to see what you are actually getting, but the LCD viewfinder drains batteries like kids suck down Mountain Dew! I use the TIFF format so I have good luck with enlargements, but they use so much card space that I had to buy a 1G card to be able to take 60 pictures. The 8 mb card that came with the camera would only take ONE! Nikon makes good products, but this is not one of them! Find a camera with fast focus, or you will wish you had!
