        A warning to those with less than nimble fingers.., November 28, 2008
        ByD. White  - See all my reviews
In looking for a point and shoot for my aged mother who is very anxious to embrace digital photography, I was naturally drawn to this camera based upon it's popularity and reviews. Here's the catch - the ergonomics of this camera, while OK, are not suited by any stretch to those who may be challenged with even the slightest hand/finger challenges. This applies pretty much across the board to most point and shoot cameras, and smallish electronics - they're just not comfortable unless you've got young nimble hands. Why can't these manufacturers take into account those who are a bit physically challenged as well? It's because they design in vacuums - I challenge them to put on a pair of lightweight gloves, then design. At least that will give some perspective.
