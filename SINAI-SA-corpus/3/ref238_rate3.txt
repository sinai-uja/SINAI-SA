        Disappointing Canon 590IS, February 10, 2009
        ByM. M. Berliner (Denver, CO USA)  - See all my reviews
  I owned two other Canon Power Shot cameras: the original A30 (3 MP), and the 530(5MP). I was most satisfied with both.  I bought the 590IS  for its image stabilization feature and the fact that it was 8 MP. I am disappointed.  I have had more blurred pictures with this camera in three weeks than I had in the entire period of my ownership of the other two cameras.  The viewfinder, a good feature not available in many new point-and-shoot cameras, is unreliable in terms of coverage; I never had this issue in either of the earlier Canon iterations.  The color is spotty. The battery life is terrible.  The motion pictures, at higher resolutions, are only 20 fps, rather than 30 in the older camras.  This camera has all the bells and whistles, and appears to be a wonderful value for the money, but performance has been a disappointment. I prefer my three year old A 530 Power Shot.
