        Canon and Sony do it again! (I'm not saying that's good), December 20, 2006
        ByMiguel Lescano Cornejo (Guayaquil, Ecuador)  - See all my reviews
This is my second Canon camera. The first one was a A75, which I bought back in 2004 and which died from the horrible defective Sony sensor (you know, horizontal purple banding) syndrome in the summer of 2006.When time came to buy a new camera, I was at first wary of buying Canon again, but ended up taking the plunge with this A630 before taking a trip to Chile. After all, Sony had said that they had already identified and corrected their mistake. FALSE. Last summer, all of a sudden I noticed that a few pictures revealed a very subtle purple banding on one of the corners. It's been a year since then, and the problem seems to have gone. I really hope Sony kill the sensor problem once and for all, and I look forward to using my A630 for a few more years.By the way, when my A75 died, Canon's representative in Quito, Ecuador did not honor the "free repair" Canon had offered for buyers affected by the sensor problem. They just kept giving me excuse after excuse. So I took it with me to Canon's repair center in Chile, where it got repaired, no questions asked.
