        Pictures are a mixed bag, but still a good buy, August 4, 2004
        ByReed (Sammamish, WA)  - See all my reviews
Pros:- Great price for an outstanding 4MP resolution- Small and light- Easy-to-use menus; lots of dedicated function buttons- Video with sound that's worth keeping!- Portraits generally look outstandingCons:- Can't remember your flash setting after turning off camera- Images generally overexposed- Trouble taking pictures when zoomed inThis is a great camera for the price, yet images can turn out anywhere from outstanding to poor.  Portraits usually look great, with soft, smooth skin tones.  But most images, taken with or without the flash, are highly overexposed.  And when zoomed in (using the optical zoom, not digital), all the pictures turn out blurry.  This happens even in well-lit conditions and when I am holding the camera still.If you are not terribly concerned about the quality of your pictures, this is an excellent camera.  But since I've found that my old 2MP Fuji camera takes better (if grainier) pictures, I'm not likely to shop at Kodak again.
