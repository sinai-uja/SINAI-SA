We have been using this camera for a few weeks. Pros: Picture quality is excellent. Small (fits in a pocket). Easy to use. Cons: Slippery: There is a small cord that you can attach to the camera. Make sure you use it. This camera is really slippery and will fall off you hand easily. The lens is not well protected -- must take extra care when placing the camera in a bag.
