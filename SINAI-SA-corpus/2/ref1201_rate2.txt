        Disappointing, February 5, 2008
        ByWilliam W. Krzymowski (Gallup, NM)  - See all my reviews
This is the fifth Kodak digital camera I have bought and like two others it has needed a major repair after a minimal impact.  The warranty is virtually worthless as the contract repair company simply says the damage was due to an impact and there is no recourse.  The prior cameras took nice pictures, however this model never did work correctly.  The flash often did not work for indoor shots.  The Kodak cameras are simply too fragile and this is the last one I will buy.
