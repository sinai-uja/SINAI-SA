        I'm getting rid of this camera., September 16, 2007

I went from the Olympus C-5050 (not a point & shoot but not professional either) to the Canon A630.  I like to take a lot of natural light pictures and this camera absolutely stinks for this.  The flash doesn't produce a lot of light and the natural light pictures are uselessly blurry even when I brace it on something to hold down movement.  I've been very unhappy with this camera in every indoor setting, shaded outdoor setting but I have been happy with it outside.I wanted a lighter camera to take fun shots with but even my fun shots like the llama show I went to.. are pretty much useless.  I'm going to be getting rid of this camera.  I've taken hundreds of pictures on it and it's just making me madder every time.
