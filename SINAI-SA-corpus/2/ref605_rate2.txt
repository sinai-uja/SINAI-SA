        Canon PS A630 Poor indoor Quality Pictures, March 25, 2007

I own a Canon G2 4MP camera that takes fantastic pictures indoors and outdoors.  It takes fantastic indoor picture without a flash, which at times is a plus because you do not lose anything in the background like you do when you use a flash.I just became a Grandmother and wanted a camera that also takes good video.  So I ordered the A630 and I am very disappointed with the quality of the indoor pictures.  It takes a fantastic video at the high setting and takes great outdoor pictures.  But is poor with indoor pics, very grainy. I tried all different settings to try and see what I am doing wrong, does not matter the indoor pics just stink.I am returning the camera and looking for a better indoor picture quality with the 640 video settings.
