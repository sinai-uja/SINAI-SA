        Sucks battery life in seconds, February 18, 2009
        ByAndrew (California,CA)  - See all my reviews
Great camera when it worked. This is my second one and the battery lid that keeps the batteies in has slightly broke and does not keep the batery firm against the metal inside to keep working.  The plastic in the battery compartment is very cheap and so is the rest of the cameras housing.  Cannon realy went cheap on this one.  Even if I hold the the battery door firm and turn on the canera , it still fails and gives me  the change batterys. Listen guys and girls, cannon makes better products then this.   I have owned the camear for record breaker of 4 months.  Im forced to send to canon for another replacement. Trust me when I say, dont buy this camera! Im sorry but its not worth the money. Sad consumer
