        Coolpix5700 Faulty Flash Problem, December 8, 2003
        ByRobyn A. Mellor (Mount Carmel, Tennessee United States)  - See all my reviews
Cons:  My husband and I purchased the 5700 in September 2002, making our decision only after reading all the glowing reviews on this overly priced camera.  Now, don't get me wrong, the picture quality is great, however, one would think the internal flash would last a bit longer than six-months!  I tried everything to restore it to the manufacturer setting - nothing worked!  We ended up having to purchase a disposal camera to take indoor shots of our sons wedding in Alaska, which will probaby be a once in a lifetime trip for us!  As for the batteries, better buy extra and get the charger for your cigarette lighter while your at it.  You never know where you might be when your battery goes dead and you miss that all to awesome shot!  Pros:  Good photo qualityBottom line:  Buy anything else but the 5700!
