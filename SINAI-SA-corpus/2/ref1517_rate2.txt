        Awful autofocus--NOT happy with it., September 7, 2002

I'm bringing this camera back in exchange for a Coolpix 4500 tomorrow.  The camera is well built, does produce high quality, sharp pictures and has a boatload of features, however the autofocus is horrid.  The autofocus doesn't work correctly in anything but bright sunlight.  If you're shooting inside under slightly darker than normal conditions, the autofocus just hunts.  It's very frustrating when you miss shot after shot because the camera is struggling to autofocus.  If you want to stay with the Nikon name, check out the 4500.  It's a far better performer.
