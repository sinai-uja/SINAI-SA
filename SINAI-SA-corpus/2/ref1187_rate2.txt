        Disposable Camera?, March 6, 2006
        ByC. Epperson  - See all my reviews
WE bought this camera 2 years ago and were satisfied until recently.  Of course the camera stops working properly when you most need it.  It started giving really dark photos the day our son was born.  Now we have all of these horrible, dark pictures of the birth of our son.  We have tried to get it serviced but every shop we take it to says that we need to mail it to kodak and that it will cost at least $150 to fix it.  I didn't realize I had bought a disposable camera.  I am really diappointed.
