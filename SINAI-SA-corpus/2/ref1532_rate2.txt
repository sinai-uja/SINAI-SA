If your seriously considering one of the pieces of junk, then please go here 1st - http://vowe.net/archives/002211.htmlThis will explain how many many people are a tad disgruntled at Nikon and this know problem. The fact that after a few months the camera will simply refuse to operate with a flash, internal OR external.Do yourselves a favor and buy another brand. The camera is shoddy and the customer support at Nikon is non-existant!
