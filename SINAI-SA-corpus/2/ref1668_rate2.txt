        Yes, it's waterproof, but very marginal picture quality, September 23, 2008

Well, I wanted this to be the camera that could do it all.  I have an old Canon S40 with a UW housing that takes excellent quality pictures - great optics for a point and shoot - but the old Canon is a bit heavy for my shirt pocket and very bulky with the UW housing.  Unfortunately, this Olympus 10mp camera takes poorer quality pictures than my old 4mp Canon S40, with or without the UW housing on.  Bright sunny day pics turn out acceptably on the Olympus, but any other lighting conditions result in dull, washed out looking, somewhat grainy pictures.  Sent it back.
