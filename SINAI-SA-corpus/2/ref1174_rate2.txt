        Camera = good; Software = horrible, November 14, 2006

I've had no problems with the camera itself, but the necessary Kodak software is so horrible, that it makes me avoid the camera too. The software makes it difficult to download select photos versus the entire collection on the camera. It also has skimpy editing features. I have to jump around from the Kodak software to a microsoft one and then another from a different website in order to get all the different changes I want in a picture.
