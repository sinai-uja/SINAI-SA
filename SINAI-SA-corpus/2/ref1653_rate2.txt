        Really surprised it is such a poor camera, March 16, 2008
        ByElwood P. Dowd (Carrboro, NC United States)  - See all my reviews
Just got the green version last week as a tougher and easier-to-carry replacement for my Canon S60, then went on a weekend trip to the beach with the family.  We split our time and pictures between hotel room, pool, and beach, so we got pictures in a bunch of different settings and lighting conditions.Overall, I have to say the pictures all leaned toward muddy, with weak color, and simply not so good.  Slow focusing was a consistent problem.  Maybe I have been spoiled by my earlier cameras (this is my first non-Canon compact digicam), but Olympus has no excuse for making such a mediocre camera in this price range.  I know they can do better, they just don't seem to be trying.  If Olumpus is skimping on the camera to pay for making it tough and still hit the $399 MSRP price point, they should consider just putting in the effort to make it a good camera and charging $449.  I would have given a good camera a better review (I only pay for the camera once, but I use it 8,000 times).I gave it an extra star for being so immersable and droppable, which is totally cool.  It made me feel better when my five-year-old would pick it up and start snapping.For the nearly $400, I simply expected a better camera.  This one will get returned.
