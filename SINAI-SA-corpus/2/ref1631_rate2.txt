I recently bought this camera. So far I have noted that its pictures have a great deal of noise and are rather grainy.  It is as sturdy as it is touted to be. I have not used underwater yet. It's picture preview is good, and the screen is bright and sharp. Takes poor flash pictures in the dark. Weak overall.
