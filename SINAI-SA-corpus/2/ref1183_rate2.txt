I recieved this as a gift a couple years ago and used it off and on up until about six months ago when I went to use it and it refused to work properly. The paper kept getting jammed and once I'd fix the jam and try with another sheet, it did it again! I'm done trying to make it work, because it's way too much of a hassle. I wouldn't recommend it if you're hoping to use it for a lot of pictures and for a longer time period than a year or so.
