This is my second Cannon digital camera, I bought the previous one(Power shot A70)in the year 2000. When compared to that camera this is not that great. The Cannon Power shot A590 consumes batteries a lot. Also I could not set the date and time on this camera, it would not stay.The only good thing about this camera is its price.
