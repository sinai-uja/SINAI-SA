        Not working well, December 26, 2007
        ByTimothy P. Dwyer  - See all my reviews
The camera seemed ok till it broke. The button that adjusts the zoom doesn't function nor does the button you press for photos. We've taken good care of it so we're surprised it doesn't work.  We're not sure what to do now. Not sure if the warranty will cover.
