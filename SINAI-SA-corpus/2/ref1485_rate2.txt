        Maybe I Got A Lemon, September 21, 2002
        ByB. Mullins "Digital Rebel" (Venice, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
After reading all of the reviews, I had high expectations for this camera.  While the menus are very complicated, and seemingly needlessly so, they can be mastered.  But the camera  doesn't seem to  be able to easily retain settings, despite following the manual as closely as possible. Battery life is quite short, despite not using the LCD screen or flash, and I couldn't find anyone that has additional batteries in stock.Other issues involved the camera's failure to connect to my computer [an iMac], although Nikon help desk couldn't figure out why.  ....My previous digicam, a Canon A20, has performed flawlessly, and in fact took pictures as good--if not often better at the same outdoor event as this Nikon.  I am not a high-end professional, nor do I think you should have to be one to produce superior results with this camera.  I bought it specifically to be able to control the exposure more, i.e. shutter speed, along with a reduced "shutter lag."So far, I'm disappointed on all counts, even allowing for my lack of sophistication when it comes to high-end digital photography.  The LCD screen is almost unconscionably small, which is housed in a much larger flip-out panel that could easily accomodate a larger one.  To me this is an indication of the haphazard approach Nikon has made with this particular camera, having had no other experience with Nikon previously.  I strongly recommend you try this out in person, and then make sure everything works before any time elapses.
