        My Flash Went Bad After Only 2 Months, October 13, 2003
        ByLarry (Columbia, Missouri USA)  - See all my reviews
Exactly two months ago I bought this camera and spent $$$ upgrading the memory and got a battery pack.  Yesterday the flash stopped working.  I contacted Nikon and described the symptoms and the rep said to send it in.  I had read all the glowing reviews posted here BEFORE I bought the camera and the one review that related a similiar flash problem...I thought his was a fluke.....NOT!!!!  We have yet to see if I get my camera back from Nikon in a timely manner and the camera,itself, stays healthy.
