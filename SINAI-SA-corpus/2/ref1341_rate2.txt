I've had this camera for a year and a half only taking pictures periodically.  I took it on a trip and was only able to take 2 pictures before the battery told me it was dead.  I thought I might have not put it on the charger correctly.  I was sure to put the camera correctly on the charger to prepare for my son's graduation.  When the moment came to take the picture at his graudation the battery was dead.  I have a friend who also had the same problem and we bought them at the same time.  So if you want a good camera for a year and a half, this is a great one.  If you want one longer, it'd be best to look somewhere else.
