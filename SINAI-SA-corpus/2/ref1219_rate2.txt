        Don't bother!!, January 28, 2008
        ByC. mccabe (Phila,PA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera because I thought 10 megapixels would be better than the Kodak I have with 4 megapixels.  It's not!  Pictures come out blurry and it take so long for the camera to actually take the picture that your subject has chaged position and the picture looks terrible anyway.  I would not have bought this camera if I had a chance to play with it first.It also needs a separate cord to work with the easyshare printer dock 6000 that I already owned.  I am going to buy another camera and let my 15 year old have this one.  Don't waste your money.
