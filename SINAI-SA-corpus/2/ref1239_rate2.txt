        Bad LCD, August 27, 2008
        ByJaclyn 0325 "Jackie" (Massachusetts)  - See all my reviews
I recieved this camera as a gift for my birthday in March, and I had to send it back in early May to have the LCD screen repaired, I had not dropped it and the camera hadn't had any impact. It took a couple weeks to get my camera repaired and it worked great. Last night my camera was in the new case I purchased (thinking it would protect it better) which was inside my purse when my purse fell off my sofa. Once again, the LCD Screen is broken. I think it is ridiculous that a camera be so easily ruined. I am not going to pay to have my camera "fixed" again, only to have it to break again in a few months. It's a shame because I took some excellent pictures with it, and I really like the panoramic feature.  I wouldn't rcommend this camera unless you're going to treat it like an "Egg Baby" for a High School health class.
