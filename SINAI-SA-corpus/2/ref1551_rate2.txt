Nikon 5700 Digital CameraBefore you make a decision to buy the Nikon 5700 camera, consider a badly designed aspect on this camera's view finder. The picture you view through the electronic view finder, lags behind the real image, and it feel like what you see is being dragged across the viewer. In other words, for a fast moving scene, it is almost impossible. Another major draw back is a flare across the view finder. On a sunny day, you won't be able to properly compose a picture more or less when you are facing a bright subject. The view finder presents a wash out with vertical strips across even at low settings of 1SO 100.
