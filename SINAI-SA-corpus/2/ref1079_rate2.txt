        Decent camera, but nothing to get too excited about, November 7, 2008
        ByChristopher Obert  - See all my reviews
I think this camera would be a great choice for someone who is looking for a cost effective digital P&S and will be only taking photos of posing adults. The features it offered were pretty neat, I really liked the option that focused on one color and made the rest of the photo black and white. Very neat. Now for the bad, my unit was slightly defective (I assume), all of the photos were slightly out of focus, resulting in fuzzy images. But most of the reviews of this camera rave about the picture, quality, so I assume that my camera was defective and an anomaly. The other issue this camera had was the delay between telling the camera to take a picture (i.e. pressing the button) and the camera actually taking the photo (i.e. the image is captured). The camera had about a 1/2 second delay between the two events. This sort of delay is completely acceptable if you are taking photos of adults who know to hold their pose. But if you are taking photos of 2-year olds, forget it. All you get are the backs of little heads. I guess it is possible that the delay in my camera was a result of the auto-focus defect. But then I went to Circuit City to compare my camera to theirs (to make sure it was defective), I noticed that the Sonys were far faster than the Canons. The DSC-W150, DSC-W170, DSC-T70, and the DSC-T77 all were noticeably faster than the Canons. All of these cameras though are more expensive than the Canon SD1100, some much more so, and they also require special Sony proprietary memory, which costs extra as well. But I must say, if you are taking photos of young children, I highly recommend that you try one of the Sonys. They are the by far the fastest cameras out there.
