        Only lasts 6 months, February 28, 2005
        Bytessa (Guarapuava, Parana, Brazil)  - See all my reviews
I was given this camera as a going away gift when I moved to brazil one year ago. The camera was fine for about 6 months. It has not been exposed to any harsh elements or dropped. I did not use anything but Kodak recommended american bought batteries. But in the summer the camera just died...I replaced the batteries with brand new ones a few times (even batteries Kodak recommended) but the camera will not turn on. Now I have a camera that DOES NOT HAVE POWER and no longer works. I even still have pictures in the camera! I contacted the company and the best Kodak can offer me is service which costs more than to buy a camera of the same quality. Overall I am quite disappointed, with the camera and Kodak company.
