        Great idea, not so great results, September 8, 2008
        ByDawn "NJHeart2Heart" (Parsippany, NJ)  - See all my reviews
I am a digital SLR user, but since I use a long zoom often, I wanted a simple camera that I could switch to for quick landscapes, instead of switching lenses all the time.  I really liked this camera instinctively; the size was small, it had a viewfinder, which is rare on compacts these days and it felt very comfortable to hold.  The on/off was excellent, and the initial response was very good.  However, after using it heavily for a full week I was dissappointed.  Though I didn't do much reading of the manual, I have a digital SLR so wasn't too concerned about working the controls.  I knew that the LCD view was not a great resolution, but it became more irritating the more I tried to review photos right after shooting them and as a result, I also did not realize that it's vibration performance was less than stellar.  When reviewing my photos after uploading to my PC, When I tried to get to the menu to adjust the review timing (to shorten it), I couldn't find it and it was more difficult to tweek it's performance than I thought, even for a basic adjustment like slight compensation changes.  As is all too typical a problem with point and shoots, it had a considerable lag time between photos.  The biggest problem, which caused me to return it for a full refund is that the decals on the mode dial RUBBED off by the end of my trip.  I'm saddened about this camera, since it seemed to have everything that I needed in a reasonable price.
