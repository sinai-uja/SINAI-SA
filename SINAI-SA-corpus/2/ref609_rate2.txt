Received the camera quickly.  I needed it for a vacation I was taking and it worked well for the first 2 weeks.  It did malfunction the last day of my vacation by not opening properly, so only had small slit which was exposed to my shots.  Small disappointment, but I hope to rectify this with the warranty or with Amazon. I have always been satisfied in the past with my purchases from Amazon.Canon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom
