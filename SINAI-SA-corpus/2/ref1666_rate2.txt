        Was great until it didn't work anymore, June 22, 2008
        ByS. Lorenzen  - See all my reviews
We purchased this for a trip to the Bahamas.  It worked fine for about 2 days of mostly land shots.  We did try a few underwater shots and got what we expected from a P&S camera.  I liked the Scene selection menu for camera settings, it was helpful and improved my ability to take decent shots in a variety of conditions without thinking about settings too much.  Solid package, nice controls, would buy again...if I trusted it.  We had to buy disposable cameras for the remainder of our trip because in 15 minutes in a 4ft 5in pool (taking photos just below the surface for fun and mostly just using it like I would a water resistant camera, it leaked water into the lens housing.  This wasn't enough to fry the electronics...just enough to make the picture all white when taking pictures (foggy is a good descriptor).  It also affected the controls because it would zoom in fully automatically each time I turned it on.I was VERY conscientious of checking the seals for debris or defect and ensureing the memory card and battery were fully seated (because I had read reviews saying people had leaks and others saying they weren't careful enough).  It still leaked and it did it around the lens housing (there's no user operated seal there, it's just built in).The search for a replacement ensues.
