        The lens error problem is for real...., July 12, 2008
        ByD. Pate (Raleigh, NC United States)  - See all my reviews
I got this camera for my daughter (in pink of course) in mid-April. She loves it (size, pictures, etc.) but after less than three months it will only flash "lense error, restart" when it's turned on. Too late to return to Amazon. :( On the bright side, a trip to Canon's website support section got me through to a Repair Request Confirmation. Hopefully, this will just cost me postage to Elk Grove Village, IL.Suspiciously, Canon doesn't list this model on their repair request input screen... makes you wonder if they're trying to discourage the onslaught of these that they're getting back for repair. Here's hoping Canon will stand behind this little jewel. If I had it to do over I'd think twice....
