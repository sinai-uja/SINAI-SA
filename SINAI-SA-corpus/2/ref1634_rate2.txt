        Poor quality / Good features, April 21, 2008
        ByIgor (Atlanta, GA USA)  - See all my reviews
The camera has cool features that you will not find on most digital cameras including the fact that it is crush proof, water proof, and freeze proof. These are all great but the quality of the pictures is lacking. I tried many different settings and set the size and the quality to the maximum size but the quality still suffered. I gave this camera 2 stars out of 5 because of the poor quality which is unacceptable for a camera at this price range and also the fact that this is the 3rd generation of these cameras. The quality of the pictures is more important to me than all of the features I mentioned above which is why I returned this camera and purchased a Canon Powershot SD790-IS. My previous camera was a Canon which I loved so I decided to stick with what I know will not disapoint me.If somewhat grainy and fuzzy pictures do not bother you and you need something that can handle rough terrain, kids, or clumsy hands than this camera is for you. If you are like me and prefer nice quality photographs than I recommend you steer clear.
