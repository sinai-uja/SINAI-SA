        Worse than the PowerShot 5MP?, December 13, 2008
        ByKickin' in PDX (Portland, OR)  - See all my reviews
We had a PowerShot 5MP previously and liked it well enough.  This model was disappointing.  Pictures in ideal lighting situations are fine, but otherwise can be less than crisp.  Given the popularity of this model is it's strong rankings, somewhat wondering whether we got a lemon.  Anyway, we returned it.
