        slow focus, slow memory, but looks nice & it's nikon, March 24, 2005
        Bya pilgrim revolutionary "lost in durham" (somewhere between layovers)  - See all my reviews
been very disappointed with the camera. i've used to travel to 12 different countries and the pic quality is good but way too slow to capture any large files other than normal and zooms so slow that it  is painful. but i am selling mine if you want to buy one.
