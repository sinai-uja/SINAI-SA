        Bad picture, September 18, 2008
        ByT. Lin (Berkeley, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
I bought this camera in April. After using it for a while I realized there is always a blue dot in the middle of my images. It becomes more obvious as I zoom in. The blue dot is everywhere: on my photos and on my video. I sent the camera back to Canon Factory in IL for repair and when it came back it still wasn't properly fixed. I just contacted Canon again and see what they will do about my camera. I am not sure if it's only mine camera that has this defect but I hope they would give me a new one if it cannot be repaired.
