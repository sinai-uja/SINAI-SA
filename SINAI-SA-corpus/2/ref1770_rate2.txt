        Pentax software is not ready for Mac Leopard , January 24, 2008

Having read all the reviews on the camera, I bought one with the 18-250 Pentax lens.  I have been using a Lumix FZ50 and decide to try a DSL and this seemed to be it.  Shooting in raw would be an advantage and did not want to spend months learning Adobe.  I tried to install the Pentax software on my Mac Leopard with no luck.  Pentax is working on the software for the Leopard but no word when it will be ready. It could be months and new model Pentaxs are coming out in less than a month.  Frankly, aside from the faster shutter, my Lumix FZ50 had far better results with its stabilizing system.  I was disappointed and returned the camera.
