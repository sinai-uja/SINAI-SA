I bought this camera for my husband to replace his sony 5mp 4 year old camera. He needed a new camera to take on a trip to Korea and other parts of asia. It takes great pictures and videoThe menue is user friendlyBUT...........................................The camera worked fine for the 3 weeks he was abroad. he took some great pictures. After he was home for 1.5 weeks the censor stopped working, just 2 days past Amazons return policy aloud for returns. Now I have to deal with Canons repair center which is a huge hastle. I feel like if the product was only used for 3 weeks that we should get a new camera as a replacement not a repaired defective camera. Make sure you use the heck out of your camera the first few weeks to be sure if something goes wrong you can return it to Amazon and not have to go to Canon.
