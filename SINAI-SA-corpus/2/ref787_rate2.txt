        Image Sensor Stopped Functioning after 2 Months, January 4, 2009

I bought the Canon Powershot SD1100 IS to replace a larger Minolta Dimage camera that I sometimes did not carry on short trips because of its size and weight.  I used the Powershot for 2 months and was very happy with the results until one day just before Christmas I powered it up and the image sensor failed to transmit a picture.  The camera had NEVER been dropped or roughly handled.  I phoned Canon technical support and learned that spontaneous sensor failure is a common problem with this camera.  And while the camera is under warranty so repair & return shipping will be free, I still had to pack up the camera and personally pay to ship it to their Powershot repair facility in Illinois.  In my opinion, spontaneous failure of a critical camera system is unacceptable, and the fact that Canon knows about this problem and still requires customers to pay to ship their cameras for warranty repair is irresponsible.  I would not recommend buying the Powershot SD 1100, and I certainly won't be doing business with Canon again.
