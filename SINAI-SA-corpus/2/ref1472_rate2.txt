        AF need serious improvement, May 31, 2004
        By A Customer
I think the camera is ok, interms of picture quality but to get the picture you want would sometime be impossible due to screwed up AF. I tried to take some pictures of kitten that are black and white stripes, and it was imposible to take a decent of kitten it self. if I focus on the kittens, it just won't focus correctly, unless you point at some surrounding object. even than blown up pictures are slightly blurie. when it comes to AF this is one POS. I would recomand this camera if you intend to take pictures of non moving object b/c of slow AF and slow shutter reponse. I have all my 35mm cameras are Nikon and really disappointed that they actually have this POS.
