        Not the best--There are better ones, July 10, 2007

I bought this camera thinking that it would be an upgrade to a 4 y/o Olympus that I had--I was wrong!This model had some very nice features and was easy to learn, but it lacks one important capability and that's (IS) Image Stabilization otherwise known as the ability to adapt for camera shake when taking a picture. I was disappointed by how many blurry images I was getting so much so that I returned it. If you want a compact camera such as this, I'd strongly suggest seeking one of the other Canon models that offers the (IS) feature.
