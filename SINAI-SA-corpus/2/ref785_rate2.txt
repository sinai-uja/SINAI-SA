This camera takes good pictures, has a decent interface, and looks nice.  But there's one major problem.  After nearly a month of use, the camera turns on, reads "Lens Error", and the lens will not retract when turned off.  Apparently this is an ongoing problem, it makes the camera completely unusable, and Canon does not admit that it's a problem.  I have yet to try returning it.  Wish me luck.
