        severely underpowered flash, December 28, 2004
        A Kid's Review
I nioted a couple of people commenting on the poor flash and then a a person upbraiding those persons for expecting too much.I have been working with cameras for about 30 years and digitals for 12 years since we had one of the early models at our our newspaper.I have used quite anumbe rof the $150 to $250 range small digitals like the 7340 and bought a 7340 for my daughter over christmas. I have to say for the price range this camera has a very poor flash. It is not just a bit underpowered but markedly so compared to this size and price range digital. when I noted how bad the flash was we compared identical indoor shot with four cameras, the 7430, a canon, an olympus and a sony all in the under $200 range of this camera. we are keeping the camera, the optics and several other elements make it a decent camera, but there is NO question this camera has a very underpowered flash. the software is also pretty cumbersome compared to other software in the class as well.
