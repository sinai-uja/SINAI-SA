        Could Use Some Improvement, October 17, 2007
        ByT. M. Urquhart Jr. "1955 T-Bird" (Baltimore, MD USA)  - See all my reviews
I bought the V1003 last week. I was impressed with the 10 MP, the price, and the printing dock. I have one question however. Will you tell me what the heck it is with Kodak that they feel a viewfinder is no longer needed??? I get a bit queasy trying to focus and compose an image with just the screen in the back. A coupled viewfinder would really make it sweet in my humble opinion. Also, the shutter recycling time is indeed a bit slow, and I don't know why. I am reconsidering my purchase for a SONY or a CANON or NIKON. It's really too bad, though! It could have been much nicer if the camera was properly designed and engineered in the first place.
