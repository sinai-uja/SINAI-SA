        Redeye, December 11, 2006
        ByMark Twain  - See all my reviews
I replaced my Canon A95 with the A630, and I have the worst case of redeye I have ever seen in a camera. The sharpness of the pictures is no different from the A95 nor is the quality of the images any better.  I may go back to my A95.
