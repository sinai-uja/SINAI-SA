        not the best, July 14, 2008
        ByT. Collado (BX NY)  - See all my reviews
This camera has lots of features, but most are not worth it.  The picture quality goes down to nothing when you use digital zoom, and videos and often dark and can not be edited.  The lense is often getting stuck on the open position, so I will return it for refund and probably go back to a FUJI camera.
