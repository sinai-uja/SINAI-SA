This is the third camera i've purchased over the past few months, guess what? they are all the same camera....each one has died with the lens error message which is quickly determined to be voided by canon 'customer service'. in less than two weeks of very casual and careful use it has barfed again and i'm once again having to pay service shipping for a product that doesn't perform and i know what the cookie cutter response is going to be. These used to be great cameras but obviously parts lately coming from 'who knows where' need a serious boost in QA to fix this lens error problem, but thats for the next sap, i'm done with canon
