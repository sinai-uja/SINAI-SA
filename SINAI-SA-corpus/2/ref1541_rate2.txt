        One big failing, September 2, 2004

Takes great pictures, but its one big failing is that its painfully s-l-o-w power up and focus makes it useless for candid people shots. My cheap little Casio digicam is three times faster on the draw. I kept Coolpix for a couple of months and then got rid of it. I lost too many shots.
