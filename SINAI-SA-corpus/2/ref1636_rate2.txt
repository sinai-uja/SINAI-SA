        Useless in poor light conditions, October 4, 2008
        ByOla E. Strandberg (Irvine, CA USA)  - See all my reviews
My son came home from a school trip with my Canon Ixy 10 (bought in Japan, called Ixus 70 in Europe) dead after dropping it or carrying it in his pocket or whatever. So, I decided on getting a camera that could take rough handling. I had a Pentax Optio WP a few years ago, so I knew that underwater photography is a lot of fun.This camera is a sturdy piece. It feels MUCH heavier than other cameras of its size, which I can live with, given that you can drop it and all. Its programs are user friendly, the software that comes with it is OK and it takes decent pictures outside, but... Don't even bother inside or in poor light conditions.Sorry Olympus, but you don't come close to my old (lighter, cheaper but much frailer) Canon in any respect. The screen is not as clear and distinct as the Canon screen either. If all you need is a waterproof camera, go for Pentax.
